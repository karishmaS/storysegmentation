 The summer movie scene is almost upon us again. Tomorrow, something called Deep Impact is scheduled to open. And later in the summer, we're going to get Armageddon. They are both trying to capitalize on the notion that here on Earth we are in danger from monster asteroids or comets hurtling in our direction. So, given what we're going to go through with the movies, let's go to the science. Here's _A_B_C's Ned Potter. Annihilation from above? It's all over the movie screens. Somebody dial nine one one. It happened to the dinosaurs. And scientists believe such calamities are routine. Things that could send civilization back into the Dark Ages probably happen every several hundred thousand years. There's now evidence to prove that. A new report says two hundred fourteen million years ago, eighty percent of life on Earth may have been wiped out by asteroids. We now suggesting that there may have been five such ah events ah that may have been ah occurred within as brief a period of time as four hours. David Rowley's team studied impact craters that seem unrelated on a modern map. But when you turn back the clock two hundred million years to where the continents were before they drifted to their current positions, the craters are almost in a straight line. Indicating that the body that collided with Earth came in in chunks. And you know, bang, bang, bang. That's precisely the kind of bang, bang, bang that happened only four years ago, as fragments of a comet went crashing into Jupiter. People could see the damage with a small backyard telescopes. ah The firestorm that resulted was ah in in each case was as large as the planet Earth. As large as Earth or as small as sand, at cosmic speeds, even the tiniest debris in the solar system can spell trouble. Each November, the Earth passes through the orbit of an old comet. Once every thirtythree years, the dust from that comet is unusually thick. The problem is that we've never had one of these cosmic dust storms when there were five hundred working satellites in orbit. Some of them could actually be knocked out. Every satellite is going to get hit. The question is how often and by what size particles? It is still safe to go outside. A mile wide asteroid hits us, on average, only once every three hundred thousand years. To scan the sky for danger, NASA's doubling its budget to three million dollars. But of course, the comet movie that opens tomorrow cost seventyfive million. Ned Potter, _A_B_C News, New York. We had planned on one more installment of our gambling series against the odds tonight when gambling comes to your town because of all the car news today we are going to hold it. We won't lose it.

 The government of India gave the world a shock today. Shortly after nine _A_M Eastern time, India told the world that it had just conducted three underground nuclear tests in the desert state of ^Rajasthan. These are the first nuclear tests on the subcontinent since India did it last in nineteen seventy four, and it took no time at all for next door Pakistan, which has fought three wars with India, to say that this was an arms race. The _U_S is very worried, as _A_B_C's John McWethy reports for us from Washington. John? Peter, within minutes of hearing the news, the _U_S condemned India and threatened severe economic sanctions. Anyone who contributes to the proliferation on the penin on Indian subcontinent is putting themselves in a position where the security of the world is at risk. A nuclear arms race in the region is the immediate concern. Neighboring Pakistan, which has been working on a nuclear program for years to protect itself from India, might now feel free to conduct its first nuclear tests. China, which agreed to stop testing two years ago, might say in self defense it must start again. Then there is Iran, which aspires to build its own nuclear arsenal, and Israel, which has the capability but has yet to openly test it. Where do you draw the line? The whole region could then argue, If country _X feels it needs nuclear weapons for its security, then I certainly do, too. So this could ignite an Asian nuclear arms race. _U_S intelligence sources say today's tests show India has a diverse program that is probably capable of producing up to sixty nuclear weapons in a year. The dilemma for the _U_S is that it has very little leverage, not only over India, but also India's neighbors. So Peter, there's a terrible fear that the nuclear genie has again escaped, and it will be more difficult than ever to control it. John, thanks very much. John McWethy at the Pentagon tonight.

 There is bad news about small pickups, which now make up seven percent of all vehicles sold, nearly a million vehicles last year. Today, an insurance group released safety tests which show the trucks are not nearly as tough as they look. Here's _A_B_C's Lisa ^Stark. Small pickups are often advertised as rough and rugged. With a tough, rugged new look. But in a forty mile an hour crash test, none of the pickups got a good rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Toyotas, Fords and Mazdas were acceptable. Chevy, _G_M, Isuzu, marginal. And Nissan and Dodge, poor. And even the safest small pickup, the Toyota Tacoma, a driver would probably suffer leg injuries in this kind of crash. In the least safe, the Dodge Dakota, look what happens to the head and neck. As a class, there's not been enough emphasis on safety in this group of vehicles. Clearly, they could and should be doing a better job of protecting occupants in serious frontal crashes. The Insurance Institute says, in many cases, the passenger compartment crumpled. General Motors makes this popular Chevy _S ten and disputes today's ratings. We try and look at all kinds of crash events and balance the performance for all kinds of occupants in a whole variety of crash events. So how do small pickups do on the road? Not well in single vehicle crashes. They're more prone to rollover. Auto companies blame driver behavior. Lisa Stark, _A_B_C News, Washington.

 In Washington, there has been another round of testy debate in the Senate about a bill to regulate tobacco. This one that would raise the price of cigarettes by a dollar fifty a pack. Those in favor, including that senator, say that if cigarettes are more expensive, teenagers would buy fewer. The tobacco companies say that price is not a factor. Mind you, that's not what they've always said. Here's _A_B_C's Aaron Brown. The industry argues that where underage smoking is concerned, the most basic law of economics does not apply, charging more will not mean selling less. As parents, we know that the reasons kids smoke aren't related to price. In fact, industry ads argue, steep price increases will only make the problem worse. There will be a black market in cigarettes with unregulated access to kids. The industry cites Canada as proof. In the early eighties, when Canada increased cigarette prices, a black market did emerge. But something else happened in Canada the tobacco industry does not mention. The price went up in Canada, consumption among teenagers plummeted. The number of kids who smoked every day dropped by sixty percent in little more than a decade. The tobacco companies know this. The evidence of their knowledge is contained in their own files. This Philip Morris planning document from the early nineties states it simply. There is no question that increasing taxes will cause a decrease in smoking. This point is best illustrated by the present situation in Canada. Five years earlier, a Philip Morris analysis of price increases concluded, Price increases prevented six hundred thousand teenagers from starting to smoke. We don't need to have that happen again. Today, Philip Morris tells a different story. There are a lot of things that have an impact on whether a kid is going to smoke. Price is not the only thing. And no one on the antitobacco side claims it is. But they do say this. If there is anything that is more effective at reducing smoking among kids than price, we haven't found it yet. And neither has anyone else. Aaron Brown, _A_B_C News, New York.

 Good evening. When former senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona died today, there were a lot of Americans who reached into their memory books to recall a story about him. President Clinton called him an American original and a great patriot. And people all over the country nodded their heads in agreement. And yet, when Goldwater ran for president as the Republican nominee in nineteen sixty four, he was regarded as an extremist. And he said in that campaign that extremism in the defense of liberty was no vice. He was an American original, a very blunt Republican who helped to redefine his party. He died at eighty nine in the western state of Arizona, to which he was so deeply attached. So first, we go to Phoenix and _A_B_C's Brian Rooney. Barry Goldwater died this morning in his home overlooking the city and state he loved. His wife, Susan, was there, and almost immediately friends began to arrive. The flag was lowered to half staff at the Arizona capitol. Goldwater was older than the state he made famous. He was vigorous and rugged into an advanced age. But two years ago, he suffered a stroke and later was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. Blunt and colorful, Goldwater was admired at the end by leaders of both political parties, including President Clinton, whose wife, Hillary, worked for the Goldwater campaign as a teenager. That he was a great patriot and a truly fine human being. He was a man ahead of his time. You look at some of the things they're doing now. He was ridiculed for those things. So he was a man of real courage, great man. Nancy Reagan issued a statement. Barry was willing to defy conventional wisdom. Although he retired from the Senate more than ten years ago, Goldwater stayed active and vocal in politics. One of his last campaign appearances was with Bob Dole. We are the new liberals of the Republican Party. Goddamn can you imagine that? Near the end of his life, he said the thing he was proudest of was being born in Arizona. Having been born in the United States and in Arizona. I don't know how the hell you can beat that. Barry Goldwater's funeral will be Wednesday at Arizona State University, followed by burial with military honors. Brian Rooney, _A_B_C News, Phoenix. In so many ways, Barry Goldwater was defined by the West. He spent thirty years in Washington, but he never did lose some of the slightly rough edges. He never wanted to. I sleep at nights. ah I have found that if you tell the truth and tell what you really believe, which I have always done, you don't spend the night tossing and squirming and thinking, God, Almighty, what did I say? Goldwater's grandfather immigrated to the West from Poland and established a chain of successful department stores which Barry ran for fifteen years. Goldwater was an Army pilot during World War two, and in time he created the Arizona Air National Guard. He loved to fly. He ran for the Senate in nineteen fifty two and won resoundingly. Hadn't been for my family voting twice, I don't know. He established his conservative views very quickly. Although he favored racial integration personally, he voted against the Civil Rights Act of nineteen sixty four. It is not the job of the federal government, he said, to legislate morality. You can't pass a law, he said, that will make me like you or you like me. Goldwater won the Republican nomination for president in nineteen sixty four. To his conservative political supporters, he was a savior. In your heart, they said, you know he's right. Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. To his opponents, including President Johnson, who he ran against, he was a dangerous extremist. In your heart, they said, you know he's nuts. Four, five, seven, With political ads like this one that suggested Goldwater would get the nation into war with the Soviets, President Johnson buried him. When you lose an election by sixty to forty, ah then you can't even begin to think of anything you might have done that would have changed it. But Goldwater's conservative views, he thought the nation could win in Vietnam if the military was allowed a freer hand, and he thought the enemy at home was the government itself, helped him to win five states in the Democratic South, which laid the ground for his party's resurgence. I give you the next president of the United States, Dick Nixon. But Richard Nixon proved that Barry Goldwater was never a slavish party man. In nineteen seventy four at the height of the Watergate scandal, Senator Goldwater was one of the first Republicans to tell Nixon that he should resign. He called Nixon the world's biggest liar. In time, he would say that Ronald Reagan was either an incompetent or a liar, when Mr. Reagan said he didn't know about diverting money to the Nicaraguan contras. In time, he would come to be an outspoken supporter of a woman's right to have an abortion. I don't think we should ever tamper with abortion. You'll never stamp it out. It's been in, it's been in existence since the world began, and it's going to be here when the world ends. And when it came to gays in his beloved military, he said you didn't need to be straight to shoot straight. In the end, Goldwater was very much with himself and his family. As he got older, he used to sit on his beloved hilltop and say of his critics, to hell with them. I'd just like to be remembered as an honest person who tried. We said there were a lot of stories from people today. Just one personal note, Ted Koppel and I were two of the young correspondents who covered his presidential campaign thirty five years ago. It wasn't always easy for us to see the man through the incendiary campaign rhetoric of the day. One of the old timers who had covered the White House since Franklin Roosevelt's first term surprised us one day when he said that if he was ever marooned on a desert island, he would like Goldwater as a companion. Goldwater, he said, would know how to get us out of trouble, and he would always make interesting conversation. After seeing the senator off and on through the intervening years, Ted and I agree today that if we were ever marooned on a desert island, Barry Goldwater would have been a perfect choice.

 And a new _U_S government report says Switzerland was not the only neutral country helping the Nazis during World War Two.

 The other major medical news is about the cause of sudden death from what is called cardiac arrest. It happens every year to almost half a million people. For no apparent reason and without warning, the heart suddenly stops. Now, this is not primarily about a heart attack. But Canadian doctors have discovered it is very much about stress. Here's _A_B_C's John McKenzie. Keeping fit, eating well. You'd think with this lifestyle, your heart wouldn't just stop on you. But it could. And new preliminary research shows the problem might be all in your head, or more specifically, your brain. We have now +shown, in fact, that there's a region of the brain controlling the heart, controlling the blood vessels. And not only does it control it, but it is actually capable of stopping the heart. It is called the insular cortex. It's about the size of a quarter, buried deep in the sides of the brain, and it's activated by stress. For the very first time, we have identified how the brain can turn stress into a cardiovascular problem. How in some people, even some healthy people, stress might kill. So you can see everything on the To demonstrate the effects of stress, scientists present volunteers with the names of colors yellow, red, blue then rearrange them so the words and colors no longer correspond. Green, red, blue, yellow, yellow. Within minutes, the volunteer is so stressed his blood pressure and heart rate have increased dramatically. But with a detailed brain scan, you can you see how, in some people, that stress triggers the insular cortex. This brain scan shows increased activity in the area as shown by this color ah in response to stress. Does everyone show this kind of reaction to stress? No, it's amazing. When you look at other people, such as this subject, you see absolutely no activity at all. Some scientists predict the next step could be the development of a simple test to identify those people whose brain is more reactive to stress so that doctors could intervene early with lifestyle changes or new forms of medication. A new understanding of the brain to help prevent deadly attacks on the heart. John McKenzie, _A_B_C News, London, Ontario.

 The leaders of the countries that grow illegal drugs and the leaders of the countries that use them will meet at the United Nations tomorrow. It's happened before, but this time one _U_N official is making the claim, seriously, that drugs can be eradicated worldwide. _A_B_C's Bob Woodruff reports. The numbers are astounding. Every year, almost five thousand tons of opium, more than three hundred thousand tons of coca for cocaine and an estimated one million pounds of marijuana and hashish are produced globally. Now the United Nation's drug czar, ^Pino ^Arlacchi, says he can wipe out the world's drugs and its suppliers in ten years. We have to fight them. We don't have to convince them. We have to know them, find evidence, prosecute and arrest them. It's an ambitious effort that the _U_N is promoting in television ads. For the first time, we have the cooperation of every nation. Critics say the plan is unrealistic. The _U_N's picked an absurd goal. ah We cannot have a drug free world. We don't have a drug free United States. ^Zeese's group has launched an ad campaign of its own using an actor's voice. Do you think the war on drugs is a complete failure? I do. Do you think if we spend more money, we'll win? Forget it. ^Ethan ^Nadelmann runs a drug policy research institute. Drug production is up around the world, prices are down, consumption is up. So by it's own criteria, the war is failing. There's no reason to believe that doing more of the same will really make a difference. In tomorrow's New York Times, an open letter to the _U_N, making that same point, signed by world leaders both present and past. Tomorrow President Clinton will be addressing the _U_N and announcing the creation of a new program to train foreign drug enforcement agents. He'll be joining thirty other heads of state in the most wide ranging global attack on drugs ever. Bob Woodruff, _A_B_C News, at the United Nations.

 From President Clinton today, strong words about not having another Bosnia. The President said today he is determined to stop what he called the human carnage in the former Yugoslavia. The President says the United States will seek a Security Council resolution authorizing all means necessary to protect civilians in the province of Kosovo. Some people are going to say the President's too late again. Serb troops, tried to crush an independence movement, have killed more than a hundred civilians and forced sixtyfive thousand people from their homes in Kosovo. _A_B_C's Jim Wooten is there tonight. American diplomats came to Kosovo today to see for themselves what the Serbs have been doing, and what they saw was more evidence that they're up to their old tricks again. In ^Decine, they found a town shelled and burned and emptied of its ethnic Albanian population by troops under orders from Yugoslav president Milosevic. At least fifty civilians are believed to have died here, and more than a thousand ran for their lives. It wasn't much of a town before it became a target, but the United States still has a considerable interest in this place and in this part of the world. For this is exactly the reason there are nearly nine thousand troops in Bosnia and five hundred Marines in nearby Macedonia, to keep the peace, to keep the war from spreading, and to keep the solemn promise of two American presidents that this wouldn't happen again. Or if it did, Milosevic and the Serbs would pay a heavy price. No one likes to see ah destruction. And um we know there have been deaths. um It's an unpleasant unpleasant thing and an unhappy thing. But for those driven from several other towns in the region, it's more than unpleasant or unhappy. It's ethnic cleansing, the same tactics Serbs used in Bosnia. The Serbs insist they have to be ruthless to stifle the separatist rebel movement seeking independence for Kosovo. There have been huge demonstrations in support of the rebels and for Western intervention against Milosevic, who promised to negotiate but attacked instead. So once again, smoke curls on the Balkan landscape. Familiar as an old movie, a television rerun. The Serbs are at it again. Jim Wooten, _A_B_C News, ^Pristina.

 In Salt Lake City this week, the nation's largest Protestant denomination, the Southern Baptist Convention, has been debating one of the most controversial statements on family life put forward by any religious group in a long time. And now, the convention has amended its basic statement of beliefs. The amendment is designed to nurture the family, but it spells out very different roles for a husband and a wife. Here's _A_B_C's Peggy ^Wehmeyer. The controversial Baptist declaration calls for a literal interpretation of biblical roles in marriage, where husbands lead and wives submit, a move Baptist leaders say is essential for stopping the breakdown of the family. That the man is responsible for doing the bread winning. The man is responsible for the protection, and the woman is responsible for seeing to it that the home has the influences in it that it ought to have. The amendment reads, The husband and wife are of equal worth before God. But it also says, A husband is to love his wife as Christ loved the church, and a wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband. In no way is the wife inferior ah to the husband. But we have different functions in the family, and this is the um model that God has given to keep everything running smoothly. This is not a new belief for Southern Baptists, but they've chosen to draw attention to it at a time when many evangelical Christians are emphasizing other parts of the Bible, which say men and women should submit to each other as equal partners in marriage. Critics inside the denomination say conservative Southern Baptist leaders are clinging to an outdated model for marriage. They ignored that portion of scripture because they're reading the Bible through a nineteenth century cultural lens and not through Jesus Christ. They hope to make June Cleaver the biblical model for motherhood. The nation's nearly sixteen million Southern Baptists are not required to follow the church's official statement of belief or even agree with it. But the new amendment does send a serious message that the Southern Baptists will continue to resist modern trends which they deem harmful to the family. Peggy ^Wehmeyer, _A_B_C News

 A Last Word tonight about an extraordinary flower. It is the very rare ^titum ^arum really rare. This one, which grew to four foot eleven in less than three weeks, is only the sixth to bloom in the United States this century. It may be a good thing there aren't too many. The flower has a powerful stench. But it is a superstar. In nineteen thirty seven, when a ^titum ^arum bloomed at New York's botanical garden, it was such a spectacular event, they made it the official flower of the Bronx, which was then New York's fastest growing borough. Stamina is another matter. This one got to full bloom only today, and it may collapse tomorrow.

 In Washington today, two more important rulings from the Supreme Court. Two highly anticipated decisions about sexual harassment. To what extent is a company liable for sexual harassment that takes place on its premises? And how easy should it be to sue the company? _A_B_C's Tim ^O'Brien reports tonight. The issue of sexual harassment on the job has always been a murky area of the law. Today's rulings help clarify when employers may be held accountable. They've laid out the road map to employers and to the courts as to liability. So this is this is a tremendous victory for women. In one case, the justices ruled employers may be held liable even when they don't know about the harassment. The court said former lifeguard Beth ^Faragher could sue the city of ^Boca ^Raton for sexual harassment by her male supervisors on the beach, even though she had never complained to city officials. I think it's a great victory for um women in the workplace, for any employee in the workplace that's sexually harassed. In the second case, the justices ruled sexual harassment victims can sue their employers even when there are no adverse job consequences. That case involved ^Kimberly ^Ellerth , a marketing executive at ^Burlington Industries. ^Ellerth claims her boss threatened to make life at ^Burlington difficult for her if she didn't submit to his sexual demands. The court said she could still sue even though those threats were never carried out. Business groups had opposed both women in court, but even they welcomed the court's clarification. They have a bright line test that makes it clear what employers must do to keep themselves from being successfully sued by employees. The court said employers must show they exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly harassing behavior and the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of the employer's preventive measures. But even with all that, the court said today if the sexual harassment results in adverse job consequences, such as the loss of a promotion or salary, the employer is going to have to pay. Peter? Tim, in light of this, several people have asked today about whether Paula Jones might reinstate her sexual harassment case against the President. Interesting parallels. The Paula Jones case was thrown out because she could not show any adverse job consequence. And today, the Supreme Court says that is not a prerequisite. And that should be of some comfort to Paula Jones and her lawyers. But the similarities of the two cases may be far outweighed by the differences. And the thinking is if this case is going to help Paula Jones at all, it won't be much.

 The new list of the world's most expensive cities is out and the _U_S doesn't even appear until number twentyone. Hong Kong replaces Tokyo as the world's most expensive place to live, followed by Beijing. The survey is based on the cost of everything from housing to food to entertainment. New York is the most expensive American city, way down at number twentyone, followed by Miami, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington, _D_C
---------------------------
 Finally tonight, the new China. Everyone involved with the President's trip to China has referred to the new China in one way or the other. During our own visit ten days ago, we didn't quite get the full import of what people meant until we saw ^Shanghai. This is a part of ^Shanghai called ^Pudong photographed eight years ago. ^Pudong was all farmland then. And this is ^Pudong just before the President arrived. ^Shanghai is the world's largest construction site. Everywhere you turn in ^Shanghai these days, something is coming down or going up. Old neighborhoods are being turned into rubble. We were there on the eightyeighth floor as they finished off the tallest building in China the old fashioned way. The driving force behind all of this is the mayor of ^Shanghai. It was his idea to have the sky line as the backdrop when we talked. ^Xu ^Kuangdi once said his city is much like the United States. Like New York City, not whole United States. I think ^Shanghai is the Chinese New York City. And what do you mean by that? Peoples walk very fast. Aggre Aggressive people want to do some business immediately. Fourteen million people in a hurry. In the ^Shanghainese dialect, the word for walk is actually run. They are running here to compete with Hong Kong and Singapore in the next century. For almost a hundred years, from eighteen fortytwo until the second world war, ^Shanghai was controlled by Europeans. The Chinese have decided to preserve the famous bund , where the docks used to be on the River ^Huangpo. But safeguarding a European heritage is very much secondary to making something brand new. ^Tess ^Johnston is an American living here who has written a lot about the old ^Shanghai, which she prefers. If some uh Hong Kong fat cat or Taiwan fat cat were to offer them a zillion dollars for that site right there, you would be amazed at how fast it would probably go down. There are all sorts of problems here, too much housing for those who can afford it. Half of these are empty. Not enough housing for the poor. Not enough public transportation. Too many cars in a city where there were hardly any a decade ago. Still, this is China's most progressive city in every way. And when you ask about China's future, here in ^Shanghai they say, You're looking at it. Not long ago, a Shanghai man is said to have written to a friend overseas who was contemplating a visit. Don't come yet, said the ^Shanghai man, It isn't finished.

 For all the attention we pay to the weather and to the climate, we can't do much about it, though the urge to do so is sometimes very strong. Case in point California. For years, Los Angeles has been getting half of its water from the Owens Valley, about two hundred miles away. And the Owens Valley has never been the same. _A_B_C's Jane ^Clayson is there. A clear day can be deceiving in the Owens Valley, because when the wind rolls over this dried out lake bed, it whips up the worst air pollution in the country, a dust storm that turns this into this. Air so dense you can't see across the street. Forty thousand people are affected. But the tiny town of Keeler gets the worst of it. This is a blight on California that should not exist. It's like a big dust pile, a hundred square miles of dust. I mean, you can't breathe it. And if you breathe it, you die. That's no exaggeration. Three hundred thousand tons of naturally occurring toxic pollutants fly off the lake bed every dangerous contaminants that are, that are present in the soil are ah are cadmium and arsenic. Owens Lake was once the center of a fertile farm and mining community. But eightyfive years ago, the newly developing city of Los Angeles, some two hundred miles away, built an aqueduct to divert the Owens River, which fed Owens Lake. The lake dried up, and the Owens Valley was stuck with the dust while the river water still flows to _L_A dirt cheap. This is environmental justice . It's just wrong for the people of the Owens Valley to have their health harmed so the people in Los Angeles can pay less for water. And so, Los Angeles is under intense pressure to put some of its water back into Owens Lake. One plan would divert up to fifteen percent of the city's water supply every year. That may be too much for the big city to swallow. But Los Angeles is offering to return some water which, along with gravel and vegetation planted on the lake bed, might control the dust. We are not agreeing to go up there and just throw money at it. We are willing to e spend what it takes in effective measures to clean it up. But nobody's holding their breath, until the next dust storm, when the big city and the small town go at it again in one of the longest running water wars in the West.

 Good morning, this is _C_N_N Headline News, I'm Judy ^Fortin. In East ^Lansing, Michigan, at least four people have been arrested after a confrontation erupted early this morning between Michigan State University students and police. The students were protesting a university ban on alcohol at a popular site used for tailgate parties before football games. Witnesses say police fired tear gas into the crowd without warning after students marched downtown and lit a bonfire. Six people were treated at the scene for tear gas related injuries, and six others were taken to a nearby hospital.

 If you haven't updated your summer wardrobe yet, you'd better hurry. Warmer weather is just around the corner. ^Elsa ^Klensch looks at this season's best buys. Suits get a new look for spring and summer. They're more casual and they get their panache from mixing and matching pieces. And they're what young designers around the world say are the season's best buys for day. Pants, skirts or dresses that work with jackets, sweaters or coats. But when evening falls, designers say it's an attention grabbing dress that wins out. New York's John ^Bartlett has a fifties film noir inspiration in his collection. He likes a mix of textures when it comes to his separates combining suits. We did a really great knitted raffia skirt that's fringed on the bottom to the knee. That's very sexy, and we're showing that with a double taffeta uh shirt jacket that's cropped and very boxy. um, and that's a perfect day look for me. and for evening? For evening we're sort of showing a silk taffeta black fifties inspired shirt dress. It's very big, and uh the skirt's very uh voluminous with a pair of double heeled shoes. Kenneth Richards is known for pieces that have an amusing rock and roll edge. This spring summer he pairs a soft suit jacket with a skirt that shows more leg. In Paris ^Martin plays with polka dot prints and sequins for an antique feeling. As for her pick of the season, it's a double layered Jersey skirt and easy top. I really like the blouson, uh, for the th th the comfortable blouson in Chinese fabric like uh I have this uh uh mm uh Vietnamese silk which is like paper and it's a little uh shiny. always goes his own way. He says he dresses a woman who's not afraid to experiment. For evening he suggests a two piece look that could be easily mistaken for a dress. I would suggest uh a white outfit with um a stretch lace mini skirt with a very light white top with it. That's very feminine and very fresh. That's the idea, yeah. In Milan ^Laurel designers Elizabeth ^Shwager and ^Stephano ^Guerrierro create clothes that are feminine yet have a sporty edge. This season they've come up with what they call a new day suit. It's a double cropped coat with a very feminine uh dress underneath in the same fabric. What's the best buy for evening? The best buy for evening is a beaded dress. In Tokyo, does a collection that takes her woman from the city to the sea shore. She uses neutrals and nautical colors that she puts in easy shapes. That's what young designers say are the best buys for spring and summer. ^Elsa ^Klensch, _C_N_N, New York.

 The leading ladies in the new movie version of Les Miserables are plotting major life changes off screen. Cynthia ^Tornquist reports. I don't mean to argue madame, my ^Cosette is a sweet little girl. Uma Thurman, who plays a mother trying to care for her child in Les Miserables, is about to become a mom herself. Y You think about it your whole life long and fantasize and meditate. Fortunately, she won't have to struggle the way her character must. She has a child out of wedlock, whom she has to hide. Illegitimacy an and being a single mother was not socially acceptable. Single motherhood will not be an issue for the mother to be. Over the weekend, the actress married Ethan ^Hawke. The couple first fell for each other in nineteen ninetysix, when they costarred as lovers in the genetically engineered world of ^Gattaca. But we do have one thing in common. How do you feel about your new role as mom, and how do you prepare for that? I don't know how you prepare for it. I e like every other person or woman who thought about having children their whole life long, overcome your own childhood, and understand your parents better, and forgive them and love them, and all those things. I don't want to take my vows papa. You promised the mother superior. I want to leave. While Thurman is looking forward to motherhood in July, her costar ^Claire ^Danes is planning to attend Yale University this fall, where she will study psychology. It's quite similar to acting really. It's the study of human nature, and I jus I'm really interested in it. It's kind of a nice balance of both being in a science and being in art. How dare you ask for the truth when you only tell me lies. At age seventeen, she already has an impressive list of film credits that include Romeo and ^Juliet and Little Women. How would you like to see your film career mature? Well, I'm going to do The Mod Squad in three weeks, which doesn't sound too mature, but it's going to be really cool and really fun. Hopefully, really good and entertaining. um I'm just taking it as it comes. ^Claire ^Danes wants to keep her life on an even keel, while Uma Thurman will juggle a film career, marriage and motherhood.

 What's the best way to get from New York to Washington, train or plane? ^Stephanie ^Oswald considers the options in today's working ahead. Honoring ^Metroliner tickets only. The northeast corridor handles more than half of Amtrak's passengers. Most are business travelers. The train is a little less expensive. The cost of a walkup train fare from Washington _D_C to New York is one hundred twelve dollars one way. Both Delta and _U_S Airways offer shuttle service for the same route. Airline walkup fares average just over two hundred dollars one way. Comfort and convenience also are bringing more business travelers to ride the rails. It is a much more comfortable ride. It's a better work environment when I want to get some work done, um, and it's just a a little bit more relaxing overall. Our stations are in center city so you are traveling center city to center city. You don't have a fortyfive minute cab ride to worry about. But even with the added time of a taxi ride, some still prefer wings to wheels. Travel time on Amtrak from Washington to New York is about three hours. But the same trip on the airline shuttle takes about one hour. That's the biggest draw for many fliers. For the speed, the convenience. I left ^Greensboro this morning. I'll be back this afternoon. Shuttles are different from regular air service. They're geared specifically toward business travelers. uh We have four inches more leg room than uh regular main line services. It's all leather seating. And we do serve, it's really the only Delta service that has uh a food service on every flight. It's one of the few places where the airlines actually have uh aircraft on reserve so if one aircraft fills up, they just pull in another one and load up people and take off. Both the airline shuttles and the train offer more than a dozen hourly departures every day. Leaving the traveler with plenty of options. ^Stephanie ^Oswald, _C_N_N, reporting.

 Some Americans contend it's _U_N sanctions, not the Iraqi government, that is causing hardship for that country's citizens. And a few are willing to violate _U_S law to make their point. Ben ^Wedeman reports. I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it These people aren't supposed to be here in Baghdad. A group of eighty three _U_S citizens led by former Attorney General ^Ramsey Clark, they're breaking their country's travel ban on Iraq. But they're on a mission, carrying four million dollars in medicine for Iraqi hospitals, and they aren't going to let the law get in the way. We come in defiance of our own government. We do not believe that any people can be forced to ask the permission to provide humanitarian aid and lifesaving relief. This is cruel. It's denigrating, it's inhumane, it's unforgiving, it's antiIslamic, it's antiChristian, it's antihumanitarian, it's antiorganism. We have a limited amount of _I_V fluids. Later they visited the Saddam Pediatric Hospital, seeing firsthand the impact of sanctions on the health of ordinary Iraqis. Tours of hospitals like this are mandatory for groups opposed to sanctions. For most of them, there isn't much doubt about where the blame lies. The United States. And in Iraq the most potent reminder of the _U_S role in the Gulf War is the ^Amaria Shelter, where more than four hundred civilians died during the bombing. But in coming to Iraq to express their outrage, they're walking a fine line. You're staying at the Rashid Hotel. Mmhm. Who's paying the bill? uh As I understand it, we are guests of the Iraq government. um, We do have some concerns. Others don't seem to mind who is footing the bill. W We're not concerned about that. We're only concerned how it is perceived in the United States. Ben ^Wedeman, _C_N_N, Baghdad.

 Labor secretary Alexis ^Herman will become the latest member of the administration to be investigated by independent counsel. Attorney General Janet Reno has recommended a counsel be named to look into allegations of influence peddling. The cost of these investigation is mounting, as Brooks Jackson reports. The investigations are expensive. To look at the Clintons' land deals, _F_B_I files, travel office firings, and so on, two Whitewater investigators, Ken Starr and predecessor Robert ^Fiske, spent a total of nearly thirtysix million dollars through September thirtieth, the most recent official figures, and probably close to forty million dollars by now. The investigation of former agriculture secretary Mike ^Espy, now waiting trial on charges of taking illegal gifts including Super Bowl tickets nearly fifteen million through September thirtieth. Former housing secretary Henry ^Cisneros, accused of lying to _F_B_I investigators about how much he paid a former mistress, five and a half million. A corruption investigation of former commerce secretary Ron brown was cut short by his death in a plane crash. It cost more than three million dollars even so. The cheapest investigation cleared former presidential adviser ^Eli Segal of doing anything illegal when he tried to raise private funds to support the federal government's Americorps program. A bargain at less than a quarter million dollars. An investigation of interior secretary Bruce ^Babbitt has just started, into whether he misled congress about an Indian casino matter. All told, _C_N_N estimates the total spent by all the Clinton administration independent counsels combined, as of today, at roughly sixtyeight million dollars. And no end in sight. How long will the Clinton administration scandal bill keep rising? No telling. The investigation of the Reagan administration's housing department scandals still hasn't shut down completely, and it alone cost twentyseven and a half million dollars at last count. Brooks Jackson, _C_N_N, Washington.

 I'm meteorologist Dave ^Hennen with your Headline News weather. Temperatures today, warming up over much of the east, back into the eighties and nineties over the southeast, still pretty chilly, though, portions of the northeast as the rain continues and rain and higher elevation snows will continue in the west with temperatures pretty chilly, only in the forties and fifties in parts of California and Nevada. Forecast later today on into Wednesday, showing low pressure moving in through the west. There'll be some uh snow continuing. Showers and even some thunderstorms in California as the rain makes it into _L_A. Look for scattered showers and storms through the Midwest. And the rain should finally taper off beginning late in the day tomorrow in the northeast. A look at Alaska, Hawaii, the Caribbean. Sunshine today in Anchorage. There'll be sunshine, too, in San Juan. A look at the extended forecast on Thursday, it begins to warm up quite a bit over the eastern half of the _U_S. We'll see scattered showers and some thunderstorms in the northwest. Strong thunderstorms possible through the upper Midwest on Friday as temperatures in the eastern half of the _U_S will range into the eighties and some nineties are expected. Warm temperatures continue right on through into Saturday.

 Nike says it is committed to improving working conditions at its Asian factories. The shoe giant announced Tuesday it is raising the minimum age for workers at shoe factories to eighteen. And it says it will improve air quality at plants, allow more independent monitoring, and provide free education classes. This sets a standard for our industry and related industries to follow. We believe that these are practices which the conscientious good companies will follow in the twentyfirst century. These moves do more than just set industry standards, they reflect who we are as a company. I don't necessarily expect you to believe that, but I will tell you this, it makes it feel better about ourselves. Critics are welcoming the changes, but they say Nike should raise workers' wages, too.

 Israel's Prime Minister is taking his country's side of the Mideast dispute to Congress and the American public. In Washington today, ^Benjamin ^Netanyahu likened differences between his government and the Clinton administration to disagreements around the dinner table. He blamed the Palestinians for the failure of the Oslo peace agreement. The deal was we give the Palestinians land, and they fight the terrorists from within that land. And of course, when we, it may have been seen and is still seen by some to have been miraculously su successful, but the reason I'm standing here as the Prime Minister of Israel was because it failed miserably, because two hundred and fifty Israelis, the equivalent of ten thousand Americans, died in terrorist actions that emanated from the areas given over to the Palestinians as part of the Oslo accord. ^Netanyahu meets with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright again today. A senior Israeli adviser says yesterday's talks were held in a productive atmosphere.

 The business week ended with a cliffhanger for folks waiting for Microsoft's Windows Ninety Eight. The new software was supposed to be released to computer makers Friday, but Microsoft is keeping it crated up over the weekend, while the company negotiates with the Justice Department and several state prosecutors for an antitrust agreement.
---------------------------
 Sources say talks between Microsoft and state and federal officials have collapsed. Both sides met for several hours today to discuss a compromise to avert a major antitrust suit that the Justice Department and twenty states want to file against Microsoft. The failure of the talks means legal action to block the release of Windows Ninetyeight will likely will announced Monday. Competitors accuse Microsoft of abusing its power in the lucrative software market.

 The world famous Cannes film festival is going on now through May twenty fourth. Michael ^Okwu looks at what an award from Cannes can mean at the box office. The gawkers flock to Cannes for this. Wideeyed glimpses of their living fantasies. Over the years, the professionals have come for a twenty karat golden facsimile of a leaf, the festival's top prize, the ^Palme D'Or. They come for this and for golden opportunity. It's the only place in the world where you have such an accumulation of uh writers, photographers uh and press. To win the ^Palme D'Or is uh the key to success here, which will then elevate the films into another orbit. Don't you hate that? It started the buzz for Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction in nineteen ninety four. Pulp Fiction eventually grossed two hundred and thirteen million dollars worldwide. It's where the whole world is at this one particular time. Organizers must have known by shipping _U_S stars to the Riviera in nineteen thirty nine they would offer timeless tonic for the cinematically crazed. Today, between two to three thousand films are shown here. It's an aroundtheclock, walltowall big screen bonanza, a frenzy of dealmaking. A lifeline for independent filmmakers. Henry ^Jaglom took his first film there in nineteen seventy one. It just changes your life, and the result for me was that I I could avoid what happened to my friend Orson Welles in life. I could avoid depending on Hollywood for my source of financing. How important is Cannes as an event to a film like yours? Cannes is probably the best place to unveil a film in the world, um, because I think it's a festival in which um films are cherished, and um th they have a history of uh promoting and being enthusiastic about all kinds of work. Writer, director Paul ^Auster is counting Cannes buzz to launch his film, ^Lulu on the Bridge. Also look for Sony Pictures Classics, Henry Fool, The Impostors from Fox Searchlight. That car that just passed us exploded. Universal is even launching a retouched version of the nineteen fifty eight classic A Touch of Evil, starring Charlton Heston. You go to Cannes to sell your current film or to find someone that'll put up the money for the one after that. Today, Cannes is becoming more important, because international box office is becoming a bigger and bigger part of every movie. Almost half of total box office receipts, according to the Motion Picture Association of America. That's partly why studios will take films that haven't reaped great profits in the _U_S, films like Dark City and Primary Colors for example, and show them at Cannes. In the high stakes marriage of commerce and art, Cannes is king. Michael ^Okwu, _C_N_N, reporting.

 Afternoon baseball, the Marlins topping the Blue Jays. Ken ^Griffey with a three run shot. The Athletics clobbering the White Sox. Scott ^Spezio with a grand slam. The Braves topping the Astros, and the Marlins beating the Cards. Mike ^Piazza with a two run triple. The Orioles have placed pitcher Mike ^Mussina on the fifteen day disabled list today, four days after a line drive off the bat of Cleveland's Sandy ^Almar broke his nose and opened a cut over his right eye. Lefty Doug Johns will take ^Mussina's spot on the roster.

 New York Yankee fans are celebrating perfection. Pitcher David ^Wells threw a perfect game against the Minnesota Twins yesterday. Gary ^Tuchman reports, ^Wells is sometimes better known for his off the field antics than his athletic ability. Inside the New York Yankee souvenir stores in New York City, there are jerseys of Yankee legends like Ruth and ^Gehrig, and current Yankee stars like ^Knoblauch, ^Cone, and Williams. But the stores don't regularly carry the jersey of the man who just made baseball history. David ^Wells is the fifteenth pitcher in nearly one hundred thirty years of major league baseball to get a perfect game, which means none of the twentyseven batters he faced reached first base. A remarkable sporting feat by a man who grew up a Yankee fan. You know it's just something that, ah, you know you have to cherish this. And, eh it really hasn't sunk in, because I'm still nervous. I'm still shaking. Coincidentally, ^Wells went to the same California high school as the only other Yankee pitcher to hurl a perfect game. That was Don ^Larsen, who did it during the nineteen fiftysix World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers. ^Wells, who will turn thirtyfive this week, is considered a good pitcher. But perfect is not a word used to describe a man who has a history of being a bit rebellious and, to put it kindly, a bit portly. But those facts make him more of a hero for many fans. He's sort of unusual looking guy for a pitcher, isn't he? But, ah, he can come up with the goods. I think the fact that he just shows you that a party kind of guy can go out, you know, maybe the night before, doing whatever he's doing, and come the next day and pitch a no hitter, a perfect game. He's had his fights in the past with the boss, Yankee owner George ^Steinbrenner, but ^Wells says he is who he is. Sometimes I just don't give a crap what, you know, what people say an and what they do. I just, you know, worry about my job and what I'm supposed to do. So is it time for the Yankee stores to reorder David ^Wells jerseys? Oh yes, definitely. We've already had a lot of questions for David ^Wells merchandise today. In the meantime, all the stores' _T_V monitors are providing perfect game replays. A perfect game is an incredibly rare feat. But by virtue of pitching one, David ^Wells now has the chance to do something even rarer, backtoback perfect games. That has never happened. Gary ^Tuchman, _C_N_N, New York.

 If you're planning on traveling this Memorial Day weekend, you may find a few surprises along the way. Dan ^Ronan has the story in this edition of Working Ahead. Travelers hitting the road for the long Memorial Day weekend will find higher prices at the nation's gas pumps. That's according to the Triple _A's monthly fuel gauge report which shows the first increase in gasoline prices in seven months. Triple _A says the price hike reflects typical increased demand for gas at the start of the summer driving season. Most travelers get an advanced boarding pass when they make an airline reservation, but this June, American, United and _T_W_A will stop issuing passes. You can still make seat reservations in advance. With the new security rules in effect that require a picture _I_D to be shown at the gate, you have to stop at the gate every single time. That smooth walk from the car to the airplane seat is no longer there. So, you've got to stop anyway. Another reason, electronic ticketing is on the rise. El Nino affects more than just the weather. The Coopers and ^Lybrand lodging research network reports demand for hotel rooms in Florida, mountain states, and the Pacific region dropped for the first three months of this year. That's when demand and occupancy are usually high as travelers head south and west for good weather or to ski. According to the lodging research network, lack of snow and unusually wet and cold weather on the Pacific Coast kept travelers away. While at the same time demand for hotels in the northeast rose above expected levels because warmer winter weather kept travelers from going south. Dan ^Ronan, _C_N_N reporting.

 A new study shows routine prostate blood screening could save thousands of lives yearly. Researchers say the controversial _P_S_A test could reduce deaths from prostate cancer by seventy percent over eight years. The test catches the disease while it's still treatable with surgery or radiation. Some cancer experts say there's no evidence removing cancerous prostate glands catches the disease before it spreads. Thirtynine thousand Americans die of prostate cancer every year.

 If you can't beat them, join them. At least that seems to be _A_T and _T's thinking. Ma bell is asking the baby bells to sell its long distance service, in an arrangement similar to the one that upstart carrier Quest has worked out with _U_S West and ^Ameritech, two of the baby bells. Just last week, _A_T and _T and other long distance carriers sued to stop those deals on grounds that the baby bells had not yet opened their local phone markets to competition.

 A _C_N_N, Time poll suggests the government's legal action against Microsoft is not particularly popular. Fortynine percent of those questioned say they oppose government attempts to reduce the software maker's competitive advantage. Thirtynine percent say they like it.

Microsoft claims the government is attacking innovations critical to the company's success.

 Depending on who you ask, this could be the busiest air travel day ever. The air transport association estimates two million Americans will fly to their Memorial Day holiday destinations today. But the airlines say they don't foresee record numbers. Triple _A predicts thirtytwo million people will hit the roads this weekend. Transportation secretary Rodney Slater is warning drivers not to drink. He's also urging everyone to buckle up and slow down.
---------------------------
 A very big piece of history will be traveling this long holiday weekend, too. The battleship _U_S_S Missouri begins what is expected to be a month long journey from the Pacific northwest to Hawaii. Japan formally surrendered to the United States on the Missouri's decks in nineteen fortyfive, ending World War Two. The Missouri will come to rest near the memorial for the _U_S_S Arizona, which was sunk by the Japanese during the attack on Pearl Harbor.

 But first we are breaking a story out of Pakistan today. _U_S intelligence sources say the country is prime to test its nuclear capability. Here's a late update from ^Jamie ^McIntyre at the Pentagon. Having been caught flat footed by India's nuclear blast two weeks ago, the United States has been spending a lot of time monitoring what is going on in Pakistan. And now _U_S intelligence sources tell _C_N_N that Pakistan has taken all the steps it needs to in order to be ready to conduct a nuclear blast soon. Sources say that using _U_S spy satellites and other means, the United States has determined that Pakistan is technically ready to conduct a test almost any time it wants. uh One _U_S official said that if it was not ready now, it would be ready pretty soon. Of course, the United States has been lobbying Pakistan heavily not to go ahead with that test in response to India's nuclear test two weeks ago. uh This intelligence assessment means the diplomatic activity will increase as the United States continues to press the case. ^Jamie ^McIntyre, _C_N_N, the Pentagon.

 A story from Oklahoma City. After pleading for mercy today, Michael ^Fortier was sentenced to twelve years in prison for failing to inform anyone of the Oklahoma City bomb plot and lying to _F_B_I agents. He said, quote, dear people of Oklahoma, I offer my apology and ask that you forgive me. Again, Michael ^Fortier sentenced to twelve years in prison.

 The hazy days of summer have taken on a different meaning in Texas. The western part of that state is getting the latest blast of smoke from thousands of brush fires in Mexico. Charles ^Zewe reports. Five year old Colby Kelly is having a particularly hard time breathing these days. When I run so fast I get the asthma. Is it the bad air? From the smoke. Air quality has gotten so bad in Houston over the last three weeks that Colby's school cancelled field trips and keeps students inside except for only five minutes a day when they're let outside to play. It's worse than I've ever seen it. In thirty years of being here we've never had to keep the children inside. Fires in Mexico and Central America have been burning for months, sending waves of smoke into Texas and twentyfive other states. Dry, which means the fires are out of control, they're much over a much broader area than they normally would be. And then the southerly winds has brought the smoke right up into the United States. Skylines have been obliterated by haze. Even the Blockbuster blimp was grounded. Because we fly with the windows open all the time, for that's the only air conditioning we have. So after a while you can definitely smell the, ah, the wood smoke. Health officials continue to urge anyone with health problems to stay inside. Don't do anything where you can't breathe through your nose. If you're doing anything hearty enough that you have to breathe through your mouth, and you have underlying lung disease, or asthma, or small babies, there is a chance over a long period of time that this could cause permanent damage. Texas senator Phil ^Gramm, meanwhile, is calling for the United States to step up fire fighting help for Mexico. My point is, when your neighbor's house is on fire and you're a good neighbor, you help your neighbor put it out. Especially if it's threatening to set your house on fire. Even though thunderstorms moving across Texas have cleared some of the smoke, it may be weeks before there's relief. In fact, weather officials say, it'll probably take a tropical storm or two with drenching rains to help put out the fires. Hurricane season begins Sunday. Charles ^Zewe, _C_N_N, Houston.

 Defense secretary William Cohen says the nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan could have consequences far beyond South Asia. This, uh, there should be no mistake about it, is very serious. Uh, the uh, you know, the road to Armageddon is paved, uh by those who are, uh, indulging in nationalistic, uh uh chest pounding and I've indicated before with nuclear weapons. And I think everyone should take this very seriously. The world should look at this very seriously. You have two countries who have been, uh uh antagonistic toward each other, have fought wars against each other, who now are running up the ladder, uh, to uh, to nuclear, uh weapons, and I think it's a very dangerous situation.

 A Massachusetts state trooper is demanding an apology from one of the attorneys who until yesterday represented British au pair, ^Louise Woodward. Brian Jenkins has the story. Elaine ^Whitfield Sharp stood beside ^Louise Woodward when a jury found the twenty year old au pair guilty of murdering the baby boy in her care. And when the trial judge reduced the conviction to involuntary manslaughter, letting Woodward out of prison, but not out of Massachusetts pending appeals, Sharp took Woodward into her home, near Boston. It's a distressing situation for a young person who's as intelligent as ^Louise and wants to move on with her life. The situation may have been distressing for Sharp as well. A Massachusetts state trooper claims she made a startling revelation after he pulled her over May twentysecond on suspicion of drunk driving. Ms. Sharp stated to me that she was an attorney for, uh, ^Louise Woodward and when she took the case, she believed that she was innocent. And she now knows that she is guilty and i is having a hard time handling it. Ms. Sharp has apparently accused me of offering, offering to release her in in exchange for sex, which would be a crime. And fondling her breasts, which would be another crime. ^Cipoletta says he may sue Sharp for defamation. Meanwhile, Woodward's three other lawyers announced the dismissal of Sharp from their team, saying she has shown, at times, an aberrant pattern of behavior. In a written statement they said we do not believe that trooper ^Cipoletta is an extortionist and a liar anymore than we believe that Ms. Woodward is a murderer and a liar. Woodward moved out of Sharp's home at the end of March. Neither she nor her former attorney are making any public comments. The remaining lawyers say Woodward's done nothing to change the opinion of anyone who believed in her innocence. Brian Jenkins, _C_N_N, New York.

 There's a small group of people who like eating the same foods as most of us, minus the preparation. ^Jeanne ^Moos has more on the raw foodists. Peel off those potholders. Stifle the stove. I've been raw now for about three years. And nothing feels as good as being a hundred percent raw. She is a raw foodist, not to be confused with a nudist, who eats in the raw. No, a raw foodist is someone who eats raw rather than cooked food. ...left and they're hearing raw food for the first time and think, what is this, the food's going to jump off of the plate? So what's for dinner? What's not cooking? Little _I_D tags help. Mock tuna, for instance, consists of soaked walnuts, carrots and herbs. Mock mashed potatoes are actually mashed cauliflower. And mock lasagna is really ground almonds with tomato sauce made in a blender. Out with the oven, in with the cuisinart. Raw foodists say, expect way more energy. They claim raw is better, because cooking kills enzymes that aid digestion. We're the only species on the planet that is cooking our food. I mean, the birds don't cook. The bees don't cook. Mainstream nutritionists say that argument is for the birds, that our bodies provide all the enzymes necessary for digestion, and that raw foodists are giving up a balanced diet. What's left to give up? Some people are fruitarians. Some people eat only fruit. And some people supposedly don't eat any food. Breathatarian. They get nutrition from the air? Well, I saw a picture, and the person looked like a toothpick. There were few if any heavyweights at this potluck dinner thrown by a raw foodist who goes by the name ^Rhio. ^Rhio is writing a raw food recipe book. An uncookbook. Featuring dishes ranging from unbaked beans to nutloaf. Even ^Rhio's cats are raw foodists. That's an organic raw chicken leg. Not everyone at the potluck felt lucky afterwards. I'm still hungry. But raw food can be as American as apple pie, raw apple pie made with a crust of ground walnuts and dates, unbaked here at a restaurant called Eight Beach Street. The pie was great, but the fishless sushi was hard to swallow. After eight months serving mostly raw food, restaurant owner ^Rune ^Kongshaug concluded, That New York is not quite ready yet. We figured as much. uhoh They're cooking more and more menu items. And, heaven forbid, a stove is on order. And don't let proximity to the menu fool you. You're not supposed to dig into the plants with a knife and fork. ^Jeanne ^Moos, _C_N_N, New York.

 Duane Walker, _C_N_N Headline Sports. Right now in Salt Lake City, the Utah Jazz and Chicago Bulls are squaring off in game one of the _N_B_A finals. Last year, you may recall, Chicago handled the Jazz in six games. This year may be a little different, with Utah holding home court advantage. We look at it in the sense that the pressure's not really on us, you know, uh because human nature says that you can't win every time you step into the finals. And we've done that, you know. But uh I like our chances either way you look at it.

 Music industry insiders are wondering what will happen to the British pop phenomenon the Spice Girls now that the fab five has become the fab four. Michael ^Okwu reports. It's been a great run. The Spice Girls defied critics when they outlived their fifteen minute shelf life in rather spectacular fashion. But some raving fans are now reeling, while entertainment analysts question their staying power, at least, now that Ginger Spice is leaving. It's affecting fans all over the country. She was the heart and soul of the Spice Girls. She really put girl power on the map. She was the one who coined that phrase. With Ginger's touch, the Spice Girls sold more than thirty million albums worldwide and built an empire projected to be worth five hundred million dollars by the year two thousand. Fortyeight hours after Geri Haliwell's announcement, _E_M_I, the music giant which owns the group's label, fell three percent on the London stock exchange. There has even been speculation that promoters of a forty city North American tour, which kicks off in Miami June fifteenth, could sue the group if profits now suffer, but insiders aren't betting on it. If anyone wanted to return their ticket, um an theoretically, it would be less than twenty percent, if each one had an equal following, there are enough people that got shut out that would buy the tickets anyway. The Spice Girls are, of course, a prefab pop culture phenomenon who survived, even thrived, after cheeky faux pas with England's royal family. Even their widely panned Spice World went on to make seventy seven million dollars worldwide. Industry experts agree with or without Ginger, their whole is greater than the sum of their parts. Onefifth of the equation is gone, so even if uh that erodes onefifth of the fan base, which I I kind of doubt it does, uh she can be replaced. The group could even exploit losing Ginger. Announce a contest and hype it t to high heaven, you know, that they're looking for a new Spice Girl to replace uh, uh Ginger Spice. It's not like they can just go out and replace her with another red haired singer and expect their fans to accept that. Some forecasters declare this is the beginning of the end. One Spice is about to pursue what all the others have had in mind for quite some time, a solo run. Michael ^Okwu, _C_N_N Entertainment News, New York.

 In Philadelphia, Mississippi, jurors have found Luke Woodham guilty of murdering his mother on the day he allegedly shot some high school classmates. Stan ^Case reports. He showed no emotion as the verdict and life sentence were read in court. Afterwards, Luke Woodham had only a few words for reporters. Where you going? I'm going to heaven now. Scoot back, now. This is God's will. about God's will This is God's will. Any last words? Last word, Luke? God bless you all. Prosecutors say Woodham killed his mother last October, just hours before allegedly going on a shooting spree at his high school in Pearl, Mississippi. Two students were killed in the attack. During this trial, Woodham confessed to the shootings, but said he doesn't remember killing his mother. His attorney says there were inconsistencies in the prosecution's case. The district attorney is sitting there, murdering your mother, murdering your mother, when the _D_N_A expert said, well, there's a third source of _D_N_A on a bandage inside of a box, which tells me that it had to be open in the house. And she gives the reason, well it could have been a stock person. I thought that was ri ridiculous. I thought it was ludicrous. Woodham won't be eligible for parole until he's sixty five years old. He goes on trial for the shootings at the high school next week. Stan ^Case, Headline News reporting.

 Those stories shortly but first President Clinton is speaking out on what prosecutors call a gruesome and racially motivated murder. Authorities say the three white men accused of killing a black man, dragging him from a pickup truck for two miles, deserve the death penalty.

I hope you will understand if I don't let the moment pass without making a brief comment about the shocking and outrageous murder of James Byrd junior in Jasper, Texas. Federal law enforcement officials are on the ground there assisting local law enforcement officials.

 John Fogerty has a new album out. The former front man for Credence Clearwater Revival says a special premonition inspired his latest project. Dennis Michael reports. Months ago, John Fogerty held a private concert at Warner Brothers Studios which was recorded and filmed for release as Premonition, a live album and video. Fogerty, who was just coming off a tour at the time, says there's a special feeling captured here. From the very first note in the very first show of the tour last year there was this whole other feeling going on, and it took me a few shows to kind of peg it, because it was so unusual and so strong, so powerful. I had a lot invested in this. This was a my whole life in music, and it was a big deal to me. But it turns out the audience had an investment, too, that I had no way of knowing about. And so I would see these people crying, and yet, singing along with Proud Mary and having a great time, crying. I remember one guy in particular, and it was Proud Mary, and the tears were coming down, and I'm singing, and I'm, what is this, what, what's causing this? That guy I actually happened to see after the show, an and I said, what's the deal? You were crying, I mean, were you having a good time or not? He says, oh, yeah, I just never thought I would see John Fogerty singing Proud Mary in my lifetime. Premonition is a joyful homecoming, but it's worth noting that Full Moon Swamp, his previous album of new material, was the Grammy winner for best rock album last year. Nostalgia has its value. That's not why John Fogerty is here. It would give me the shivers to ever be thought of as a oldies act. The day I die I hope I'm working on writing a new song.

 Travelers may want to check health insurance plans before heading out that door. ^Kalin ^ThomasSamuel has details about emergency coverage in this edition of working ahead. Most travelers never consider the thought of medical emergency during a trip. The risk for travelers in general, _U_S and international, are uh, number one, accidents, number two, cardiovascular disease, and number three, infections. If a crisis threatens your travels, it pays to understand your health insurance policy. Most plans will cover you under any circumstance. But there are exceptions. Some _H_M_O_s won't cover the cost of an emergency room visit if the condition could have been treated at a less expensive facility. For example, a small health care clinic can easily take care of illnesses like colds and flu. Some health plans have their own clinics. So before you go, check to see if your _H_M_O has one at your destination or if it offers treatment through an affiliated clinic. I think you'll find most uh plans are going to cover you adequately for anywhere in the United States, whereas when you travel internationally, oftentimes you will need a rider on your insurance policy in order to have the proper coverage overseas. It's especially important to consider additional health insurance if you're going to less developed countries. You can buy the extra coverage at travel agencies. Most travel agents are very familiar with different types of insurance policies uh for medical coverage as well as evacuation insurance. The cost is about five dollars and fifty cents for each hundred dollars of coverage, meaning a ten thousand dollar policy runs five hundred fifty dollars. There's even evacuation insurance, which pays to get you out of one country and into another in a medical emergency, coverage worth considering if your next trip is wild in nature. ^Kalin ^ThomasSamuel, _C_N_N, reporting.

 Smoke from raging wildfires in Florida has gotten so bad, firefighters can't even see the flames anymore. The national guard is flying over the state using infrared equipment to locate flames. Hundreds of residents were forced from their homes near ^Ormond Beach Tuesday, for a second time in twentyfour hours as fires threaten their neighborhood. Reinforcements, including twenty bulldozer teams, are working to beat back the flames. Fortytwo additional firefighters arrived Tuesday, including several from Tennessee. Since memorial day, fires have charred one hundred and eighteen thousand acres across Florida.

 At the _C_N_N weather center, I'm ^Byron ^Miranda with a _C_N_N Headline News Weather update. Midsection of the _U_S, one frontal system will bring some rain showers over the next twenty four hours from the midwest, back through the northern plains, headed towards the northeast by Friday. Out west, the northwest looks pretty good, but rain showers in the forecast along that one frontal system through the eastern section of Montana, into Idaho and Wyoming. The high pressure continues in the dry weather across the southern section of the _U_S, and the stormy weather is not the story across the south, it's the heat. Boy, one hundred degrees, the century mark again through Texas and through parts of the Gulf coast. No relief in sight. You need to stay indoors and don't do any physical exertion during the m afternoon or evening hours. Wait late, late, late at night before you go out and do some physical exertion. Extended forecast looks like this, the heat continues across the eastern half of the nation. In fact, those nineties are starting to inch up through the northern plains. Rain showers in the forecast for the northeast because of that one frontal system in the midwest, and will slowly make its way to the northeast by Friday and Saturday. That's a look at your _C_N_N Headline News Weather.

 Imagine getting a rental car counter, getting there, and finding out the vehicle you had, well you thought you had reserved, isn't there. That's happening more and more often. In today's edition of Working Ahead, ^Kalin ^ThomasSamuel has what to expect if that happens to you. Rental cars are in high demand this summer. And scenes similar to one played out in a Seinfeld episode are becoming more common. I don't understand, I made a reservation. Do you have my reservation? Yes, we do. Unfortunately, we ran out of cars. But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation. I know why we have reservations. I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. Car rental companies say they use yield management systems to have enough cars on hand for peak demand periods. But ^Hertz says it could be caught short if customers don't return cars on time, or abuse the system. Sometimes people just don't show up, and sometimes people make multiple reservations and use one and then don't bother to cancel the other ones. This ties up the cars, so other customers who may have reservations might not get one. So if, like Jerry, your reserved car isn't available, most rental car companies will upgrade you to the next size car at no additional charge. When no cars are available. The next step is that they will send you to a competitor. The next step is to take a taxi into town and try to rent a car at one of the, uh, off airport sites or an in town site. And in that case, the car rental company should pay that cab fare. Making your reservation early, and guaranteeing it with a credit card, can help ensure you've got a car when you need it. ^Kalin ^ThomasSamuel, _C_N_N, reporting.

 Authorities in North Riverside, Illinois say an eightytwo year old woman was among ten people who were hurt today when part of a supermarket roof collapsed. They say she was trapped for two hours and suffered a broken ankle. Authorities don't know what caused the accident. Witnesses say water from overnight storms seemed to have collected on the roof. Repair workers were also on the roof at the time. While I was shopping at Riverside mall at the time. And, I came out and I heard a loud bang. And next thing you know, I saw a lot of squad cars and police activity here. So I went to come and see wh what the problem was, and I talked to someone and they said that the roof collapsed. I guess there was people working on top of the roof, fixing the air conditioning or something like that. And there was people shopping at the time, inside. North Riverside is about ten miles west of downtown Chicago.

 The legal ramifications of sexual harassment are getting easier to understand. The Supreme Court handed down a pair of rulings Friday that clarify when an employer is responsible for harassment. The decision will make it easier for victims to sue the companies or other entities they work for. In one case, a Chicago woman sued her former employer, saying a supervisor threatened her job if she didn't sleep with him. In Florida, a former lifeguard sued the city of Boca Raton because two supervisors harassed her. The court upheld both cases, even though the employers did not know about the harassment.

 Almost half of all Americans say they're eating less red meat and an increasing number say they're not eating it at all. Linda ^Ciampa reports on how this is affecting people's health. In the grocery stores, in the sky, in the restaurants, requests for meatless meals are on the rise and eating vegetarian has gone mainstream. You know, just to be healthy. You know, I'm like thirty now, so. It's a concern for your body. It's a concern for your environment. It's a concern for, for many people, it's religious reasons. This looks delicious. Right now, it's estimated one out of every twenty Americans is a vegetarian. And whether it's fast food or five star you crave, it's possible to eat vegetarian almost anywhere. McDonald's is even test marketing a veggie burger in New York. Adopting a vegetarian diet can be extremely healthful. Many studies have shown people who eat more fruits and vegetables have less hypertension, heart disease, obesity and certain types of cancer. But there are a few nutritional pitfalls you need to look out for. Too many high fat cheeses, milk, yogurt and nuts, and you could end up gaining weight. And without the right variety of food, you could come up short on certain nutrients such as vitamin _B twelve, calcium, iron and zinc. One way to deal with it would be to, uh, use supplements. For many people, uh, that's acceptable. For others, it isn't. Second choice is, uh, various kinds of special, fortified foods. For instance, _B twelve fortified or calcium fortified, uh, soy products are available now. The American Dietetic Association has developed a vegetarian pyramid that offers guidance. And you don't have to go completely vegetarian to do yourself some good. Eating meatless meals a few times a week and enjoying more fruits and vegetables can go a long way toward better health.

 From the midwest to the east coast, it's a weekend of violent weather in parts of the _U_S. Heavy rains and severe winds caused flooding and power outages across West Virginia today. Hundreds of people have been evacuated. Nationwide, storms have claimed at least seven lives. Floods forced residents in one Ohio community to leave their homes. They were allowed to return yesterday. Flooded roads in Vermont are preventing workers from restoring power to some seventeen hundred customers. And the southern half of Iowa will be under a flash flood watch this afternoon as another round of storms is expected to move in.

 This is Dennis Michael with the Hollywood Minute. Minnie Driver is getting a little help from her sister on her next film. The actress will star in Glamour Girls, according to Daily Variety, and Kate Driver will produce the picture. The sisters' production company is called, ready? Two Drivers.
---------------------------
 A survey by Triple _A finds that one in four Americans admits to driving aggressively. That translates to forty five million aggressive drivers, a much more common problem than road rage. Drivers with road rage attempt to hurt people with their vehicles. Aggressive drivers just lack regard for the safety of others. When asked to describe their aggressive driving, fifty eight percent of those surveyed said they speed, especially when running late. Twenty three percent said they change lanes excessively, and eleven percent admitted to tailgating.

 This is The World. I'm Lisa Mullins. The Middle East peace talks in London are going into overtime, but no one is predicting victory. Secretary of state Madeline Albright, Israeli prime minister ^Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat have all agreed to spend tonight in the British capital. They will continue to discuss a _U_S proposal for Israel to hand over more occupied land to the Palestinians in exchange for tougher security guarantees. The World's Allen Dow has been monitoring the negotiations in London. Allen, the peace process, as you know, has been deadlocked for more than a year now. Is there any sign that these talks in London could achieve the uh necessary breakthrough? Well, it's anybody's guess eh at the moment. The talks uh went ahead all day long. They uh, in fact, they talked longer than they thought they would, the first round of talks today. Um, secretary of state Albright met with the Israeli leader for nearly five hours. Um, that was longer than anybody expected. She met with uh the leader of the Palestinians, Yassir Arafat for about ninety minutes. But afterwards, you know, nobody was very optimistic, including the, uh, h her spokesman, James Rubin who said to reporters a little bit later on that, ah, that the optimism was not high based on the evidence that uh has been seen so far, but they're going to continue to work at it, th ah, meaning the United States. And what else are we hearing? What have the parties themselves been saying so far, if anything, about what's been happening today? Well, the parties uh themselves are, are basically finger pointing at each other. The Is the Israeli leader, ^Benjamin ^Netanyahu came out and said that um, after tha those five hours of negotiations that that he thought that progress was being made. But the Palestinians have said all along that they think this is just a stalling tactic, that in fact, uh the Israeli leader is is just trying to buy some time here and make it look like he's negotiating when, in fact, there are no ah real solid proposals on the table. And the way these talks are happening, uh no facetoface talks apparently right now, the different parties, Yassir Arafat and ^Benjamin ^Netanyahu are actually in different hotels. That's right. the ^Madeleine Albright has been sort of shuttling back and forth uh through the day and the night speaking to both sides. Um, the two sides will not meet together. Uh, they may at some point, but right now that's just not in the cards. The _U_S proposal is for Israel to withdraw from another thirteen percent of the West Bank. Uh wh why is it that uh ^Benjamin ^Netanyahu cannot accept that? Well, he says that ah Isr i i it's a question of security and that Israel ah really can't give up anymore than nine percent uh of the west bank. If you look on a map, Tel Aviv v, the capital, is very close to uh, to uh the west bank, which, of course, is is the biggest occupied territory. They say to give up any more more of that, it would uh, it would place t the the capital in jeopardy from further attack. And is there anything new on the table in these talks today? At the moment i it's not clear exactly what is on the table. These talks are being held in private. Nobody's letting us know what is going on. But um e everybody seems to be pessimistic right now that uh things are not looking too good. The World's Allen Dow speaking to us from London. Thanks very much, Allen. Thank you.

 _U_N secretary general ^Kofi ^Annan has faced a fierce attack on the United Nations during a visit to the Rwandan Parliament. Rwanda's foreign minister said it was simply not good enough for Mr. ^Annan to blame the nineteen ninetyfour genocide on a lack of political will among the international community. _B_B_C _U_N correspondent Rob Watson is traveling with Mr. ^Annan. The minister made a catalog of criticisms of the _U_N, even blaming its predecessor, the League of Nations, for Rwanda's history of ethnic violence. In response, Mr. ^Annan said he hadn't expected to face such charges in the Parliament and that he wasn't prepared to get into an argument. But departing from his prepared speech, he said clearly there were failings and he regretted more hadn't been done to prevent the genocide. Rob Watson, _B_B_C news, ^Kigali, Rwanda.

 On the West Bank and in the Gaza strip today, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians marched to commemorate the founding of Israel in nineteen fortyeight. Unlike the recent observances in the Jewish state, the Palestinian marches were sober, remembrances of what the Palestinians call , or the catastrophe, the uprooting of their people fifty years ago. The marches were interrupted by violent clashes with Israeli soldiers, and up to eight Palestinians were killed. The World's Richard Myron reports from ^Ramallah on the West Bank. Palestinians marked today with official ceremonies and with spontaneous outbursts against Israeli troops. Here on the outskirts of ^Ramallah in the West Bank, hundreds of young Palestinians have gathered to give vent to their frustrations, as they throw rocks and hurl insults at Israeli troops in the distance. The road's covered with rocks and stones, and a cloud of acrid black smoke hangs over the area from burning tires. Soldiers respond with sporadic rounds of rubber bullets and tear gas. ^Orsummer is thirty years old and lives in ^Ramallah. In nineteen fortyeight during the first ArabIsraeli war, his family fled from ^Jaffa, now in Israel. Today, he's come here to show his anger. All the people are here to, to press themselves that eh we have arrived in Palestine. We have arrived in ^Ramallah . And we want eh our eh comprehensive peace. Throughout the whole of the West Bank and Gaza strip, thousands of Palestinians gathered to remember what they call the , the catastrophe of war, dispossession, and exile, which for them was marked by the founding of the state of Israel in nineteen fortyeight. At midday, people packed into the center of towns and cities and stood to attention in silence as sirens rang out. In stark contrast to the celebrations in Israel two weeks ago to mark fifty years of the Jewish state, this is a day of mourning, anger, and reflection for Palestinians. Palestinian authority President ^Yasser ^Arafat made a defiant address in a radio broadcast. We're not asking for the moon, he said. We're asking to close the page on the . We want to establish our independent Palestinian state on our land, like all other peoples. At ceremonies all over the West Bank and Gaza strip today, this theme of ongoing struggle fifty years after the founding of the Jewish state, has been repeated. ^Sergei ^Salamar is head of the _P_L_O's department of refugee affairs. The Palestinians are saying now, we are ready to continue, we are ready to go in our struggle for our uh national goals. The state, Jerusalem, and, of course, the right of return to the uh homes. Frustrations in the West Bank are at their peak. And today's trouble was the bloodiest in almost two years. It comes at a time when the peace process is in deep trouble. ^Yassim ^Fatib is a commentator on Palestinian affairs, and he says that the protests are more connected to the events of today than history of fifty years ago. The content in which the Palestinians are uh commemorizing this event, is full of bitterness and sort of hostile kind of political thinking. Had the peace process been more successful, I think the Palestinians would have commemorated this incident in much lower profile. The Israeli prime minister ^Benjamin ^Netanyahu is in Washington today to try and break the deadlock on the peace process. But the chances of a breakthrough appear slim. And as the talking appears to be grounding to a halt, so the potential for the kind of lethal violence witnessed here today is increasing. For The World, this is Richard ^Myron reporting from ^Ramallah on the West Bank.

 This is The World. I'm Tony Kahn. A hundred years ago the United States emerged from the Spanish American war a world power with a reach that extended to the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico. For Spain, the war also marked a turning point. Madrid was forced to cede those three territories to the United States and grant independence to another of its possessions, Cuba. This week our series on the Spanish American war's legacy has focused on the war's victor and the spoils of victory. In our final report, The World's Megan Cox ^Gerden examines the war's disastrous yet strangely liberating impact on the loser. By eighteen ninetyeight Spain had been fighting a fullfledged Cuban insurrection for three years, and its draconian tactics were provoking an international outcry. Spanish troops were rounding up Cuban civilians into what were effectively concentration camps and laying waste to the countryside. Peasants were dying by the tens of thousands. With the sensational American press of the day amplifying every atrocity, it became impossible for _U_S politicians to ignore continued Spanish rule in Cuba. Historian Edward ^Malifakis at Columbia University in New York believes the American press inflamed the public's desire for _U_S military intervention in Cuba. Spanish behavior was there was obviously cruel, but no crueler certainly than it usually is in, you know, most wars and nothing remotely like the kind of th stuff that's happened subsequently. But it was enough to create a movement in the United States of th a prowar movement. The Spanish government resented American interference in the running of what Spain believed to be its God given empire. So, as American newspapers overflowed with gory tales of Spanish cruelty in Cuba, and American politicians demanded that Spain let Cuba go, Spanish newspapers were whipping up sentiment against the United States. Caricatures depicted Spain as a ferocious lion and the United States as a pig, wallowing in its wealth but too fat to fight. In truth, the Spanish lion was geriatric, toothless. The cost of maintaining its occupying army in Cuba had left Spain nearly bankrupt. The war on that rebellious island brought heavy social costs as well. Resentment seethed among conscripted soldiers who were in Cuba only because they couldn't afford to buy their way out of the draft as the aristocracy could. Accounts from eighteen ninetyeight show that Spain's top military men knew they couldn't prevail against the United States. Spanish politicians knew it, too. But according to Mark ^Hayes, a historian with the _U_S Navy, Madrid felt it could not back down. In general, I mean I have a lot of sympathy for the Spanish government at the time, because they're, they're trying to put things back together after a lot of problems that really began with the French intervention in the country in the Napoleonic wars. And they're still trying to deal with the effects of that. That French intervention started with Napoleon installing his brother as king of Spain and ended with the great armies of Europe fighting it out on Spanish soil. The wreckage of that war left Spain in a terrible position to take on the United States in eighteen ninetyeight. But Jaime ^Ojeida, who recently retired as Spain's ambassador to Washington, says the weak government in Madrid was squeezed by circumstance. The Spanish, uh, th public opinion was very strongly moved by the idea of uh honor, the honor of the country, the honor of the armed forces. But Spanish honor was no match for a superior foe. And Spain's American colonies fell swiftly, first Guam without a fight, then Cuba and the Philippines with the Spanish fleet sunk in a day in each place. By the time American troops turned their guns on Puerto Rico, Spanish resistance had lost its gusto. Recently opened diplomatic cables to Puerto Rico from Madrid show that Spain instructed the island's defenders to resist if possible. Historian Luis ^Agrait of the University of Puerto Rico says that was a far cry from Spain's noisy vow to defend its empire to the last peseta and the last man. Spain would have preferred to avert a war. Spain, apparently, the government uh feared that if they lost Cuba eh without putting up a fight, first of all the monarchy could collapse, uh and there could be a, a financial collapse in Spain, and uh there would also be a a collapse of the public finances. As it happened, none of the worst Spanish fears, apart from losing Cuba, materialized. The monarchy and government both survived the war. Spain's economy improved and Spain enjoyed a renaissance of culture and ideas, a rejuvenation that historian Edward ^Malifakis says sprang from humiliation. You go and fight against an enemy and, you know, the enemy hardly without uh any effort dest defeats you and that s reveals your incompetence and your backwardness and so on, so there was a great psychological shock to them. That shock produced what's called the generation of eighteen ninetyeight, a loose collection of writers, artists and thinkers who used the disaster as a way to probe the deepest questions of Spanish identity. The generation of eighteen ninetyeight was sometimes pitiless in its introspection. One leading intellectual, Ortega ^Igaset, wrote, Spain today, rather than a nation, is a cloud of dust remaining after a great people have galloped down the highway of history. Spain was no longer an empire. Again, former Spanish ambassador to Washington, Jaime ^Ojeida. It was a medium power. Not maybe, not a strong. Economically rather backward, with many problems at home. A loss of Cuba somehow removed the shackles of um imperial ideology, a bit like what happened in Great Britain after the second world war, and the nation started uh beginning to think of itself as uh Spain, following the British example, as little Spain. Loosing what ^Ojeida calls the shackles of imperialist ideology did not produce overnight the peaceful European country Spain is today. Far from it. Spain was to endure civil war and a thirtysix year dictatorship before emerging as a stable democracy. But historians believe eighteen ninetyeight was a turning point in Spanish history, when Spain woke up from its long imperial dream. For The World, I'm Megan Cox ^Gerden reporting.

 Ah, for the glorious life of the foreign correspondent, aye? Well, it's more of a grind than the movies and novels would lead you to believe. So when the _B_B_C's _U_N correspondent Rob Watson learned he was going to cover the recent African trip of secretary general ^Kofi ^Annan, he was kind of looking forward to it. Normally being the _B_B_C's United Nations correspondent means leading a fairly sheltered life. I spend most of my days prowling the _U_N's corridors for quiet chats with diplomats and officials. My only contact with the outside world is the taxi ride downtown to my home. So the idea of being set free in eastern central Africa was very appealing. Now I've done it, here is the unadulterated inside story of what it's like to accompany the _U_N secretary general. As part of Mr. ^Annan's entourage, I discarded any notion of customs, immigration controls or any of those other tiresome bureaucratic necessities, instead swanning off the _U_N's private plane from limousine to hotel. With smug glances at stamp wielding officialdom. I also received ^Kofi ^Annan's own personal travel tips which are, eat when you can, sleep when you can, and go to the can when you can. Then there's the ubiquitous red carpet and being mistaken for a _V_I_P. Not surprisingly, perhaps there was little way for the waiting dignitaries at the numerous airports we arrived at to know who was and was not important in the secretary general's party. So they tended to err on the side of caution addressing all of us as your excellency. Very satisfying. But there is a real down side to traveling as a high profile diplomat, even if you're only being mistaken for one. Here you are surrounded by roaring lions, volcanos and other natural wonders when all you see is the inside of ministries and hotels. That said, there are great and unexpected moments which bring diplomacy to life. For example, our unscheduled refueling stop at ^Kartum in Sudan. And the comically frantic search by bemused local officials for some member of the government for Mr. ^Annan to meet on a quiet Saturday night. But the most striking thing about getting away from New York was seeing issues not as abstract matters being tossed around by suited ambassadors, but as real problems involving real pain. When I stood with Mr. ^Annan on a hillside in Rwanda looking at a make shift museum full of the skulls of thousands of genocide victims and feeling the anger of the survivors, I was chillingly reminded how those whispers in corridors back in New York can often mean the difference between life or death for people thousands of miles away.

 Back for the answer now to our geography stumper today. We're in search of a group of very small islands in the Indian Ocean that belong to the British but are used by the _U_S Navy.

 A sixteen year old Springfield, Oregon, boy was buried today. Ben Walker was one of two ^Thurston High School students killed last week in a shooting rampage. ^Colin ^Fogarty of Oregon public broadcasting reports. A prayer opened the funeral at the Springfield faith center, which was packed for the service. A dark casket was surrounded by flowers and adorned in the school colors. Walker was sixteen. He was shot in the head last Thursday morning when a gunman opened fire on a crowded school cafeteria. Springfield mayor Bill ^Morrissette said the tragedy could only be made worse if nothing good comes as a result. Ben was a was the victim of this terrible thing, and I think we owe it to Ben and we owe it to Ben's family to to make sure that something is done. A second student, Michael ^Nikaulawson, will be buried tomorrow. The fifteen year old suspect, Kip ^Kinkel, remains on a suicide watch in a juvenile detention facility.

 It was a grim day at Air France terminals today with some ninetyfive percent of the French national carrier's pilots on strike. Negotiations are set to reopen tomorrow in an effort to avert a chaotic start to the World Cup soccer tournament. ^Sarah ^Chaise reports from Paris. Most of the hundred thousand passengers who would have flown Air France today were aware of the strike and made alternate plans. Strikes are a fact of life here, though this one is particularly ill timed. Some two million soccer fans are expected to inundate the country starting next week. The Air France conflict is over a management demand that the pilots take a fifteen percent pay cut in return for stock, and over the extension of a lower pay scale for new hirees that was supposed to be phased out yesterday. Today the president of Air France said he'll consider the pilots' proposal for a time limit on the fifteen percent pay cut. Negotiations are set to open tomorrow.

 In southern Africa, elephants in Zimbabwe are suffering from a new disease which prevents them from feeding themselves. It's known as flaccid trunk paralysis. And that means they can't use their trunk to eat. A leading veterinarian in Zimbabwe Chris ^Foggen says it's easy to spot elephants with the problem. The end of the trunk is unable to grasp the vegetation and it's unable to then flick it into its mouth. We believe that the most likely cause is a toxic plant or plants growing on the lake shore in that area. But we certainly haven't identified the plant responsible. Chris ^Foggen in Zimbabwe.

 Californians are going to the polls today in what's turned out to be the most costly and volatile of primary races. Voter turnout is expected to be high. _N_P_R's ^Kerry ^Kahn reports. The largest number of voters in twenty years is expected to cast ballots in the state's first ever open primary. Election officials are hoping for a fortytwo percent turnout. Topping voter interest is a three way competition for the democratic gubernatorial race. At one point in the lively primary contest, each of the three leading candidates have held the first and last place positions in the polls. Currently lieutenant governor ^Gray ^Davis is the front runner as voters appear to be turning to his decades of political experience over the selffinanced campaign of millionaire Al ^Checchi, and trailing in third is congresswoman Jane ^Harmon, who has apparently been unsuccessful in her attempts to tap into the gender gap. Voters will also decide on nine ballot initiatives, including one that would curtail labor unions' political activities and another that would end the state's thirty year old bilingual education system. ^Kerry ^Kahn, _N_P_R news, San Diego.

 The retired admiral who investigated the intelligence community's failure to detect last month's nuclear tests in India has found numerous lapses in how intelligence was analyzed, but admiral David ^Jeremiah says no disciplinary action is required. _N_P_R's Martha ^Raddatz reports. ^Jeremiah said that the intelligence community and policy makers misjudged India's intentions by assuming its political leaders would behave as those in the _U_S do, sometimes making campaign promises that they don't keep. India's _B_J_P party had promised its people that a nuclear test was forthcoming, but _U_S analysts didn't believe it. But there were other errors, starting at the senior levels on down. The organization needs to be scrubbed, and I'm talking about the intelligence community organization, not necessarily the _C_I_A. _C_I_A director George ^Tenent says he will accept all of admiral ^Jeremiah's recommendations, making it the highest priority to implement each of them.

 Today in Geneva, hundreds of children from Africa, Asia, and Latin America descended on the headquarters of the International Labor Organization to protest the exploitation of child labor. The demonstration was the climax of a six month global campaign against child labor practices. It also coincides with the _I_L_O's annual conference, which hopes to come up with new legislation to abolish the worst forms of child labor worldwide. As ^Clair ^Dual reports from Geneva, the protests are an attempt to get governments to take action against child labor. These seven year olds are scavenging for coal in a mine near the Colombian capital, Bogota. The poorest of the poor, they survive by selling the coal to middlemen. The _I_L_O estimates two hundred and fifty million such children work in developing countries, with particularly high numbers in Asia and Latin America. Global March organizer ^Kylash ^Satiati, says both developed and developing countries have long ignored the problem of child labor. There is a serious lack of political will right from the countries up to the international level. So it was necessary to mobilize the whole world against the menace of child labor. For the past six months, march participants have been calling for an end to child labor, taking their protests to fortythree countries on four continents. But child labor is not just a problem of the developing world. It's estimated one million children pick fruits and vegetables in the United States as well. Global March participant Diana ^Mull says it's a disgrace that children are exploited in such a highly industrialized country. The United States is going to point a finger at other countries and say you need to clean up your act, then the United States needs to sweep on its own doorsteps and clean up its own act. This is a time when we need to put a spotlight and focus on ourselves and make a change. Worldwide only sixty countries have adopted conventions on abolishing child labor. Most developing world countries including the United States have refused to ratify a minimum working age of fifteen. The ^ILO director for child labor ^Asephy ^Bekhali admits there's been limited progress in getting children off the work bench and into the school yard. The _I_L_O cannot enforce international law through uh military means, but there is a moral pressure, there is public pressure, which I think acts as a major deterrent. The _I_L_O is proposing a new convention on the elimination of the worst forms of child labor, including slavery, prostitution, and hazardous work, but such legislation can only be adopted in nineteen ninetynine and ratified much later. For supporters of the global March, that's too long to wait. Organizer ^Kylash ^Satiati says it's a crime against humanity to subject children to bonded labor. His group rescued seven year old ^Nasheva from a life of slavery in the carpet industry outside Delhi. He says that three of us tried to escape one day, but I was caught by the employer, he took me and um put me in lock and key for the whole day. Then in the evening he brought a stove, with some red hot iron, and then branded my whole body with those iron rods, and I lost my speech. I was crying and crying, and then I lost speech. Bonded labor is a problem not just in India but across south Asia. Pakistan has come under heavy international criticism for the pay and conditions of children stitching footballs for the world soccer cup. Its child labor expert at the _U_N, ^Tamina ^Janjoor, says Pakistan will sign a new convention banning extreme forms of exploitation. But, she says, when children are the sole breadwinners, the solution is to provide education in the workplace. She warns, however, that an immediate improvement is unrealistic. We all want the elimination of child labor, but the problem is we are a developing country, and even in the most industrialized countries, child labor continues to exist. So while they have not been able to completely eliminate child labor, to expect that certain developing countries w where questions of survival are important questions are expected t t to overnight to change the situation, that, I'm afraid, will take a little bit of time. Global March activists believe poverty is not an excuse for waiting to eliminate child labor, but results depend on countries not only signing the convention but also implementing it, and that means cracking down on companies that exploit child labor. That will be the next step in the long battle against international child labor practices. For The World, this is ^Clair ^Dual in Geneva, Switzerland.

 Nigeria's politics leave much of the world in dismay, but its music is a whole other story. The The World's ^Marco ^Wurmin reports. The name says it all, King ^Sunny ^Aday. He is Nigeria's king of the music known as ^JuJu ^Highlife. This track, Easy Motion Tourist comes off King ^Sunny ^Aday's latest release. It's in part an assessment of his life as a musician and in part a little wishful thinking. The easy part, anyway. In nineteen eightytwo, after fifteen years of relative obscurity, King ^Sunny ^Aday landed an international recording contract with the Island record label. His first release on Island, ^JuJu Music sold rapidly to Island devotees. Island had been dealt a blow by the death of their number one artist, Bob ^Marley, and was looking for fresh talent. King ^Sunny, they hoped, was their answer. While King ^Sunny ^Aday did in many ways fuel the hunger for socalled world music, his tenure with Island records lasted only three years. In nineteen eightyfive, after King ^Sunny's third release, which featured Stevie Wonder on harmonica, the same listeners who got hooked on ^Aday's debut and followup albums ceased to be dazzled by the guitarist's complex rhythms and ^Yoruba language lyrics. King ^Sunny ^Aday's new album is on the Mesa Blue Moon label and still shows the guitar's virtuosity. He doesn't bring the freshness of an undiscovered talent anymore, but this veteran gives a strength to this album that a young Turk could not. With the news today of general ^Sani ^Abacha's death, it's interesting to note that one of king ^Sunny's early recordings in Nigeria was entitled the Late General ^Metala ^Mohammed. That hit record was an homage to the country's most beloved military dictator. For The World, this is ^Marco ^Wurmin.

 President Clinton has signed a two hundred three billion dollar transportation bill into law despite the claims of critics who say it's stuffed with election year pork. And the president says tough negotiations between the White House and lawmakers have reduced the measure enough so that it won't bust the budget. The bill's designed to fund highway and bridge repair and construction for the next six years and it includes thirty six billion dollars for mass transit.

 The Japanese yen came out of free fall today as the markets took stock of Washington and Tokyo's efforts to save the currency. Yesterday _U_S treasury secretary Robert ^Rubin began a massive campaign to buy yen. Today the Japanese government promised, again, to tackle its economic and banking problems, and Saturday deputy finance ministers from around the world meet in the Japanese capital to discuss further action. But despite the hubbub, Tokyo based business journalist Ken ^Bellson says most economists remain cautious. Even Robert ^Rubin a uh acknowledged, and uh as the Japanese authorities have acknowledged, uh temporary intervention is great, uh, it shows the uh direction and intent of the government, but it's only a uh temporary uh stopgap, if you will. Uh if nothing, it only slowed the decline ah of the yen against the dollar, it didn't uh reverse it per se uh and if we don't see any major action from Japan, if they don't come up with the goods that America is requiring, then we'll probably see the yen go back towards one fifty again. And we can look for some sort of uh action happening with the meeting of the uh deputy finance ministers from seventeen nations? Uh, that's right, uh although some of this will be window dressing. There's quite a bit of evidence to show that they were going to meet anyway. They h had an annual meeting scheduled, so uh the fact that Lawrence Summers flew over, uh the deputy treasury secretary came over at this time, was all fortuitous. Uh, I think some of it was choreographed for maximum impact. Still, the Japanese are acknowledging uh more and more that it's time to really get serious about fixing their banks, uh get serious about really trying to get money back in people's pockets. Mmhm. An and how is the Japanese government explaining its failure to so consistently address the banking problem after what seemed to be years of warnings? Uh, that's a good question, actually. In fact, uh they're not addressing it uh and that's basically been the policy here. There's a lot of distrust on, on many people's parts because the finance ministry really hasn't come clean and admitted that they were one of the prime movers in the problem. Mmhm. I want to, I want to look at a different angle of this, Ken. There is e enough bad news uh that's been oo oozing from all of this for quite some time now, but we shouldn't ignore the fact that when bad things happen to overseas markets, uh some good can in fact come out of it, particularly here in America. What are the benefits for _U_S consumers, the benefits from, from this t trend to deappreciation of the Asian currencies? There is a silver lining here, isn't there? Uh, sure. Uh, well, obviously uh cheaper Asian currencies and a stronger dollar mean prices are basically held low down at home. Uh, imported goods, uh generally including uh cars from Japan, are cheaper than they would normally be or at least give the opportunity for cheaper prices. Uh, I know a recent visit back to the States showed me that uh Nissan was cutting prices of their cars, and I'm sure this is one benefit of a stronger dollar. It also uh helps uh American companies who are interested in uh buying companies uh in third countries in Asia. There have been a couple of high profile deals, and particularly the uh car company Ford has made some moves in Asia because prices are so cheap now. Uh and the third thing is uh the move here by the _U_S government to strengthen the yen uh will also keep the stock market uh from tumbling. There were some nervous jumps down in the past couple of weeks in the American stock market, and uh this seems to have a abated that kind of nervousness. Of course we should also look at the other side of that, being the fact that, that when uh for instance, imports, when the price of imports to the _U_S go down, we have figures s such as those that came out today from the _U_S government saying that we had the highest trade deficit ever announced for a single month. Uh, yeah, that's correct, uh although uh trade in general, and the case in Japan as well, trade is only about ten to twelve percent of the economy. So on the one hand, uh yes, it's a horrible number. On the other hand, uh in the grand scheme of things, America's economy can absorb a lot of that. Two thirds of America's economy is you and me going to the stores and buying things, uh consumer spending. And so on the whole, uh America's economy is still quite vital uh and can absorb that. Ken ^Bellson is a writer on the Japanese economy for ^Bloomberg's news service in Tokyo. Ken ^Bellson, thank you. My pleasure.

 President Yeltsin has warned Russia's parliament not to block the economic reform program presented by his Prime Minister ^Sergei ^Kiriyenko. He told the deputies that they have less than a month to approve a major overhaul of Russia's tax system and large spending cuts. Here's Andrew Harding in Moscow. The government has been trying to push through some of these changes for years, but the parliament and Russia's powerful regions and vested interest groups have dug their heels in. Now, though, time is running out. The government is hoping to secure massive new loans from the International Monetary Fund to tide it over. But the _I_M_F, knowing it has the upper hand in negotiations this week is imposing strict conditions. Pleasing the _I_M_F and the Russian parliament is almost impossible at the best of times. Prime Minister ^Kiriyenko has a fight on his hands. Andrew Harding, _B_B_C news, Moscow.

 On the eve of President Clinton's trip to China, there's been further pressure on Beijing to come clean on its human rights record, but Chinese authorities are doing all they can to ensure there'll be no dissent when the president and his entourage arrive. Today it was reported that the former Chinese party leader, ^Zhao ^Zujang, has written to Chinese communist leaders calling on them to admit it was a mistake to use troops to quell the ^Tiananmen Square uprising. The World's Rob ^Gifford in Beijing says no one was surprised by ^Zhao's statement that Chinese government owes its people an apology. Well, I think uh he would say that, wouldn't he, is what many people would say. um And uh inevitably he was the party leader who was forced to step down in may of nineteen eightynine for siding too much with the students during the demonstrations, but I think what it does show is that there are still people who are willing to speak out, people with some clout like ^Zhao ^Zujang. And if this letter can be confirmed, which is obviously very difficult in Beijing at the moment, some people have said he could emerge as something of a figure head in any opposition movement that were to arise in future, but it must be said that in the current uh circumstances, I don't see that that is uh seen as a likelihood by many people. Another sign that people are looking at today is the uh detention of uh a fellow named ^Li ^Zhao ^Long who apparently is a dissident there. Tell us who he is and what the significance of his detention is. Well there are people like Mr. ^Li. A lot of people have said that with the uh eh g the sending of and ^Wei ^Jing ^Chung into exile uh within the last few months, uh that all political opposition has been quashed o or sent out of the country. There are people who continue to speak out who are not such high profile dissidents, uh so like m this Mr. ^Li. But I think the important point here is that people like ^Li, at the moment whatever they say, whatever anybody says, that might rock the boat ahead of Mr. Clinton's arrival is being clamped down on. So the government is so keen for nothing to cause problems for this summit, that if anybody makes a squeak that even seems like dissidence, uh they're going to be stamped on. What else is the government doing along those lines, Rob? After all, a lot of people are going to be watching what the president does, what kind of controls is the government exercising over uh their ability to hear and see that? Well, as usual, it's going to be very uh high security in ^Tiananmen Square itself, but one of the things that has been reported, again not confirmed, is that uh is that American officials hav uh have complained to the Chinese about uh the screening of President Clinton's uh remarks after President Clinton and Mr. ^Jiang meet in the great hall of the people on Saturday. That uh there are reports that there's going to be a twentysecond time delay uh so that anything that is too overtly pro human rights or too antiChina in any way can be edited out so the Chinese people won't see it. I think the ordinary man on the street, he's not going to get to see much of Clinton. And to be honest, there seems to be more interest in the soccer world cup at the moment than there is in the visi visit of President Clinton. The World's Rob ^Gifford in Beijing. Thanks a lot, Rob. Thanks, Tony.

 President Clinton's visit to China is being watched with particular interest in Hong Kong. Human rights remain a concern in the former British territory, which was handed back to China last year. Democracy campaigners in Hong Kong say the release of a few high profile dissidents by the Chinese authorities is not enough. Hong Kong legislator Emily ^Lau hopes the President will strengthen the cause of reform in China as a whole. We welcome the President's decision to visit China. We want the Americans to engage the Chinese, but not just on the economic front, on the military front, or the security front. But we also hope the president will speak out very loudly and clearly on questions of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. Hong Kong activist Emily ^Lau on the Clinton trip to China.

 For those of you who know the music of Cape Verde's Grammynominated ^Sasaria ^Evera, the sounds of today's musical closer may be familiar. The World's ^Marco ^Wurmin tells us about ^Sasaria ^Evera's New York based adopted daughter. ^Francilena ^Dural ^Almaida goes by the name ^Phancha. Her connections to the diva of Cape ^Verde music ^Sasaria ^Evera are tight. A mutual friend introduced the two of them when ^Phancha was thirteen. ^Phancha and ^Sasaria immediately became inseparable. She would take me everywhere with her in Saint Vincent, wherever she would go to sing. She would always take me. I would always be with her. So people started like getting confused you know, because uh they thought I was the one who was ^Sasaria's daughter. Many people, even now, people who doesn't know me personally, thinks that I'm ^Sasaria's daughter. That's why they said that ^Sasaria's my adopted mother. We have a great relationship as mother an and daughter, and family. I really love her. On ^Phancha's American debut recording, you can hear the influence of ^Sasaria ^Evera. Being with her, learning with her, I think I did took a way of her singing, but I created my own self. I created uh my style of sing. I I don't compare myself ever with ^Sasaria, you know. But it's like, you know, I want to be ^Phancha, and I am ^Phancha, and ^Sasaria is ^Sasaria, and she will always be. I came over here just to have a uh concert, and then to go back. But somehow I really got attracted to big apple. I decided to stay. The big apple seemed seductive at first. But when her music career failed to take off, ^Phancha found herself cleaning apartments for a living. America, it's a country of opportunity. But you got to do what you have to do to survive. So when I came over here, I sang at the beginning one concert, and that was it. I decided to stay here, who knows, maybe this album might help me change my life, but from from now, I'm very proud to say I came to _U_S I had to do what have to do to take care of myself and my family. The cover of ^Phancha's new _C_D shows her strolling on Coney Island. Coney Island because it reminds me a lot of uh one of the beach in Saint Vincent. Actually very close to my, to my home. I like five minutes I can even walk from my house to that beach. That's why I choose Coney Island to do the, the cover. ^Phancha recorded the album in her native Portuguese. If you don't speak the language, just soak in the music. You'll get fluent pretty quickly. For The World this is ^Marco ^Wurmin.

 President Clinton, continuing his tour of China, is due to spend another day in Shanghai. He has described the financial center as the place where east meets west. Mr. Clinton has already answered callers on a radio phone in and taken part in a round table discussion with community leaders. Subjects discussed included China's future and its recent past. When it comes to just creating more opportunity for people to have a better life, uh in refraining from oppressing people in, in horrible ways, I think it's obvious that China, since the end of the cultural revolution, has made enormous progress, I mean, i n almost unprecedented for any society in human history. President Clinton in Shanghai.

 Violence also struck festivities in Turkey. Several hundred leftists clashed with police in Istanbul when they were prevented from joining an official May Day rally. Dozens of people were hurt.

 Time now for sports and Dave ^Bird's right here, and he's getting rowdy. That's right. It's, you know, not nearly as rowdy as some of these guys in the _N_B_A. This was, this was very amusing. We have television screens in the studio and they just showed the videotape of ^Alonso ^Mourning and Larry Johnson trying to fight one another last night. um ^Evander ^Holyfield is not worried. I'll get to that story in just a minute. But, the Charlotte Hornets will try to advance to a meeting with the Chicago Bulls in the _N_B_A playoffs in a few hours. They will be taking on the Atlanta Hawks in the eastern conference, Charlotte leads the best of five game series, two games to one after losing game three ninetysix to sixtyfour on Tuesday. ^Glen ^Rice says that having the lead is no advantage. I really want my team to look at it as if it's two two an and we've got to try to wrap it up Friday. uh We don't need to keep go going around here saying, that _O_K, it's two one, we have an edge. We don't have an edge. The Hawks have a chance to even this series at two games. Each game five is Sunday in the hive, that's the uh Charlotte home court. Meanwhile in the western conference, the Houston Rockets will try to deliver the knockout blow to the mailman, ^Karl ^Malone, and the Utah Jazz. Houston leads the series two games to one after scoring an eightynine to eightyfive win over Utah. Wednesday Jazz forward Jeff ^Hornasec says that his team will have to put that loss behind them. We've always been good at uh shrugging it off, putting it in the past and uh uh coming out and playing uh the next game and we did that in game two again and ah we're going to do it in game four. The winner of the Utah Houston series meets the San Antonio Spurs in the conference semifinals. And now to Mr. ^Mourning and Mr. Johnson who could take some +lessons from Mr. Howard, ^Mo Howard. uh They will both be sitting out the final game of their best of five game series between Miami and New York on Sunday. That's because they decided to whale on one another with less than two seconds left in the game Thursday night. The _N_B_A says, boys, you can't do that. You have to play nice with others. They will be you land a punch or not. That's true. I'm watching ^Alonso, man, and he's like wailing and he didn't connect with one of them. It's like so if you're going to pay the twenty thousand dollar fine, and sit out the final game, at least hit the man, but he didn't do that. ^Mourning was fined twenty thousand dollars, Johnson will have to pay ten grand. Chris Mills of the Nicks was uh suspended for one game, fined twentyfive hundred dollars for leaving the bench during the fight. All three players will miss the fifth and deciding game of their team's first round playoff series in Miami Sunday. Now, depending on the outcome of that game, either ^Mourning or Johnson will have to sit out the first game of the eastern conference semifinals against Indiana or the first regular season game next year.

 I'm John ^Brouchard in Washington. At least seven people have been killed and several more wounded in violent protests against the rule of General ^Sani ^Abacha in Nigeria's second largest city, ^Ibadan. _V_O_A correspondent Purnell ^Murdock has details from our west Africa bureau. Witnesses say police opened fire on hundreds of protesters as they tried to set fire to buildings and cars believed to belong to supporters of military ruler ^Sani ^Abacha. The headquarters of the ^Ibadan based news was the home of a man who organized a pro ^Abacha rally in ^Ibadan several weeks ago. Opposition leaders accused the police of attacking the demonstrators. They also accused radical youths of committing any acts of violence. ^Ibadan, in southwestern Nigeria, is a stronghold of opposition to military rule. Nigeria's second largest city has been the scene of past violent confrontations between government security forces and the political opposition. Security officials have warned that they will use force to put down any antigovernment protests. Purnell ^Murdock, _V_O_A News.

 Israeli Prime Minister ^Benjamin ^Netanyahu says considerable gaps remain between Israeli and Palestinian positions before next week's talks in London. He and Palestinian leader ^Yasser ^Arafat meet separately Monday with _U_S Secretary of State ^Madeleine Albright. At a news conference with _U_S Vice President Al Gore in Jerusalem, Mr. ^Netanyahu suggested Israel might be willing to move a little on issues holding up peace, but he said he expects an equal effort from the Palestinians. If Israel is asked to uh stretch itself on matters that are vital to its security concerns, then we must see an equal effort on the other side. Mr. Gore called on Israel to continue taking risks for peace.

 Meanwhile, Mr. Annan has appealed to the world to give money right away Canadian dollars for but had received pledges for only twenty percent of that amount. The Sudanese government has responded to warnings of massive famine in southern Sudan by more than doubling the number of relief flights allowed into the threatened area. Mr. Annan's comments came during a news conference in Nairobi as Sudanese peace talks got under way. The Sudanese military government and southern rebels are talking, but there is little hope the discussions will bring an end to the fifteen year civil war.

 Ten former guerrilla fighters with the African National Congress are seeking amnesty from South Africa's truth and reconciliation commission for deadly bombings carried out during the apartheid era. The hearing began today for the guerrillas, who belonged to the _A_N_C's military wing. They're expected to tell about their involvement in a South African bombing spree between nineteen eighty and nineteen eightyeight. The attacks left more than twenty people dead and three hundred fifty wounded. The first witness, ^Ismail ^Aubuka, says he regrets the loss of civilian life, but says he believes the _A_N_C's struggle was just.

 Whether the _U_S Central Bank will raise interest rates is a big question. Stock investors had bid stocks up on hope that interest rates would fall and move corporate profits higher. The Asian financial crisis was expected to drag down the _U_S economy, but that hasn't materialized as much as many had forecast. And now some, including _I_M_F managing director, ^Michel ^Camdessus, says the Central Bank will have to raise interest rates, if not this month, then later.

 The _U_S Education Department says more than six thousand children were expelled from public schools last year for bringing firearms to school. The department says most of the expulsions for the nineteen ninetysix, ninetyseven academic year, fiftysix percent, were from high schools, while thirtyfour percent were from junior high schools and nine percent from elementary schools. The issue of guns in schools has received renewed attention in the United States after several recent deadly shootings by students at schools.

 _U_N secretary general ^Kofi ^Annan has also criticized the Indian government for carrying out the tests. A +spokesman for Mr. ^Annan, ^Juan ^Carlos ^Brant, says the _U_N chief considers the test as a violation of a ban on nuclear testing, even though India is not a signatory to the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. The secretary general is nevertheless concerned that the latest testing is inconsistent with the patent which has been firmly endorsed by the international community. _U_N spokesman ^Juan ^Carlos ^Brant.

 One of Turkey's most prominent human rights activists is fighting for his life after being shot by i unidentified gunmen. ^Akin ^Birdal, head of Turkey's human rights association, is in critical condition at an ^Ankara hospital. ^Amberin ^Zaman reports. Hundreds of human rights activists, journalists, and ordinary citizens continue to wait outside ^Ankara's hospital where Mr. ^Birdal had surgery to remove three bullets lodged in his chest. Mr. ^Birdal, head of Turkey's largest human rights grouping known as the Turkish human rights association was hit in the chest, shoulder and leg by six bullets fired by two unidentified gunmen. His secretary who witnessed the attack said the two men, both said to be in their mid twenties asked to see Mr. ^Birdal around noon local time. When they they were told to wait, they burst into his room, started shooting and immediately fled. Mr. ^Birdal, a staunch defender of Turkey's ethnic ^Kurds was frequently accused by state officials of being a sympathizer of the outlawed ^Kurdistan workers party, the _P_K_K. The group has been waging an armed campaign the past fourteen years to gain self rule for Turkey's estimated twelve million ^Kurds. Mr. ^Birdal denies the accusations. ^Amberin ^Zaman for _V_O_A news, ^Ankara.

 There have been more arrests in Nigeria following violent antigovernment protests several weeks ago. Among the latest is prominent civil rights lawyer ^Alissa ^Abadcova, leader of the ^Lagos based civil liberties organization. Correspondent Purnell ^Murdock reports the arrests have sparked fresh criticism of military ruler Sani ^Abacha's human rights record. Human Rights Watch, a _U_S based human rights organization, says ^Alissa ^Abadcova is being held in detention under deplorable conditions. The organization says he has been denied access to his family and legal representation. Human Rights Watch says he is being held in solitary confinement and has begun a hunger strike to improve his conditions. Mr. ^Abadcova was arrested by Nigeria state security service on May eighth as he was returning from a trip to Ghana. No reason was given for his arrest. Members of Mi Badcova's civil liberties organization say five more members were arrested on Monday. They say security forces seized records and equipment from the ^Lagos' offices. Human Rights Watch says the arrests of Mr. ^Abadcova and his associates fits a pattern of harassment of human rights activists aimed at preventing them from exercising their right to free speech guaranteed under international law and the Nigerian constitution.

 India says it is not bothered by the possibility of a Pakistani nuclear test following New Delhi's five nuclear tests this week. The Prime Minister's political advisor, ^Prahmud ^Mahajan told the French News Agency that India conducted the tests after considering its consir uh, security concerns, so others are free to consider their own. Earlier, Indian officials said the country can withstand economic sanctions imposed by the United States and others, in the wake of this week's nuclear tests. The officials say the Indian economy is strong enough to offset the ban on bilateral aid, which they say amounts to only a tiny fraction of the gross national product. The United States, Wednesday, imposed strict trade sanctions against India, and is urging other countries to do the same. So far, only Japan and Australia have announced the halt of all nonhumanitarian aid to India. In a sharp warning to the New Delhi government, Pakistan has told the opening ses that it will take whatever action is necessary to protect its people from what it called the growing menace of Indian nuclear weapons. Pakistan's representative was the first of more than thirty countries to condemn India's underground nuclear tests. More from Lisa ^Schlein. Pakistan rejected international calls for restraint in responding to India's nuclear tests. Ambassador ^Munir ^Akram told the _U_N conference on disarmament that his country would decide alone what measures to take to guarantee its security. He said India's actions pose an immediate and grave threat to Pakistan's security, and will not go unanswered. We will not accept unilateral obligations or commitments. We will not accept commitments which would permanently jeopardize the ability of Pakistan to deter the nuclear and conventional threats which India poses to our security. We will not allow ourselves to be subjected to any conspiracy to compromise Pakistan's security. The Pakistani ambassador criticized other countries for having ignored warnings that India was about to conduct nuclear tests. He also denounced several industrialized countries, including Canada, the United States, Russia, France, and Switzerland, for what he called actively assisting India in developing its nuclear and missile programs. Mr. ^Akram said, this week's series of Indian nuclear weapon tests have significantly altered their strategic and security situation in the region. His fears and condemnation of India's actions were echoed by representatives from more than thirty other countries. One by one, countries which included the United States, Japan, China, Russia, and Germany, expressed shock over India's open defiance of the international community. However, India's ambassador, ^Saditri ^Kunady, remained unrepentant. In undertaking these tests, India has not violated any international obligations or undertakings. The decision to undertake these tests was taken after due consideration of our national security requirements. Ambassador ^Kunady said India remained fully committed to the complete elimination of all nuclear weapons, and would participate in what she called effective universal negotiations to achieve a nuclear disarmament agreement.

 A state court in Missouri has ordered the makers of a fake version of the antiimpotence drug, Viagra, to mail refunds to thousands of men who thought they were buying the real thing. The court also ordered the producers of the fake supplement to pay nearly a hundred and seventy thousand dollars in fines. The company operating under the name America Neurological Clinic sent out mailings to older men offering a seventyfive day supply of the antiimpotence drug for eightyfour dollars. The company got about nine thousand responses. It is not clear if the fake versions actually helped anyone.

 Opposition leaders may not have liked what President ^Suharto had to say, but several countries in the region have praised the President's speech. Australia welcomed Mr. ^Suharto's pledge. Prime Minister John Howard said if the Indonesian President holds elections soon, it will show that he has put the interests of the people first. The Japanese foreign ministry issued a statement calling for a quick end to the confusion in Indonesia. And China expressed concern about the political turmoil, and said it hopes the situation will be resolved shortly. Britain has warned its citizens to leave Indonesia as soon as possible. An official of the foreign office in London said it would be best for British citizens to leave Indonesia within twentyfour hours. The official estimated there are hundreds of British citizens still inside Indonesia.

 A Canadian television crew using a hidden camera has captured dramatic videotape of suspects being beaten at a Chinese police station. The videotape was shot through a window across an alley from where the suspects were being interrogated at a police station in Shanghai. It shows them handcuffed to a window grate, being punched and slapped during questioning. Multiple suspects, all with their backs to the camera, were given similar treatment. The videotape was aired Monday in Canada. The Chinese foreign minister has ask, was asked last month whether Chinese police routinely beat suspects in detention. He said such practices are expressly forbidden by Chinese law. Human rights groups say Chinese laws that prohibit beatings under detention are rarely enforced. A security official in Shanghai told the French news agency the Canadian videotape is a sheer fabrication, and he's threatening to sue the network.

 India has strongly defended its decision to test five nuclear devices. The Prime Minister Aktal ^Bahari ^Vajvais says New Delhi was forced to conduct the tests in self defense and to silence its enemies. Prime Minister ^Vajvais said it is unfair for the world's nuclear powers to expect other countries to refrain from stockpiling their own nuclear devices. Mr. ^Vajvais was also quoted by Indian news agencies as saying he's ready for a peace dialogue with Pakistan, provided Islamabad takes the initiative. Mr. ^Vajvais visited the ^Pokran region of western India where the nuclear tests were conducted earlier this month. India has maintained that nuclear tests did not release radiation into the atmosphere. But villagers who live near the test site have complained of an increase in nose bleeds and skin irritation. Doctors in the region say those reactions are symptomatic of the hot, dry desert air and soaring summer temperatures in ^Pokran.

 That sound was heard in a lot of places in the United States on Wednesday. It's the sound of a computer printing out Powerball lottery tickets. People lined up in the twenty _U_S states and the District of Columbia selling the tickets Wednesday to take a long shot on a dream, a dream to be a multimillionaire. Now, it's a long shot, I must say. The odds of winning the one hundred seventyfive million dollar are about eighty million to one. People, according to the mathematicians, are more likely to die falling out of bed or getting struck by lightning. It is the largest jackpot ever in the United States. _V_O_A Today's ^Sara Williams visited one lottery ticket dealer in Washington and asked people waiting in line why they were taking the chance despite all the odds. Probably just the amount is worth taking a shot at. Uh, do you know many people that are, some of your friends or family members that are doing this, that are getting into this? Oh, yes, very much so. It's quite the, uh, ordeal at work right now. And how many tickets have you bought all together for this? Uh, my first five. With the jackpot as high as it is, it's worth five dollars out of my money, so. Uh, how many tickets are you getting? Five. A dollar each, and figure you throw i -way and any other time so you might win, have a chance. Do you know many people, many of your friends or relatives that are doing this? Uh, no, because I, my friend relatives aren't here, a lot of my friends in different places in _D_C just throw a couple of dollars in and figure it's worth a shot. Are you pretty excited about this whole Powerball thing? Yes. Why? Because of the amount? Yes. Are, do you regularly buy lottery tickets? Not really. Not often. Uh, what's different about this one? The money. The amount of money. Are, do you know many people, friends or relatives that are going ahead and buying tickets for this? No. Not really. We're from Maryland, so we have to come to _D_C so we don't play, play it a lot. How many tickets are you getting? Five. Do you normally buy lottery tickets? No. Uh, what's special about this one. The prize. Now, now usually. I think they've said that your chances of winning this are fairly small, but same as being struck by lightning. i heard this morning odds are about the same as the prize from what I understand. One in a hundred and seventyfive million or something like that. But it seems like people are pretty excited about this. Well, somebody will be one of that one, so. How many tickets are you getting. One. Just one? Because a number of people I've talked to are getting five tickets. I guess they have more money to spend than I do. And, how, how much are they? I believe they're a dollar. Well, good luck. Incidentally, the winning number in the Powerball lottery, the winning numbers, will be picked tonight in about five hours. Uh, the lottery jackpot's a hundred seventyfive million dollars. I can tell you one thing. If there's nobody here tomorrow, Bill White, the engineer, Frank ^Vail, the uh, or Bill White the director, Frank ^Vail the engineer, and me, if uh, none of us are here you know why, okay.

 Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the _U_S Central Bank, says it is still too soon to tell how much effect the Asian financial crisis will have on the _U_S economy. He also says it is still not clear how bad the situation in Asia will become. Although the tendency in recent months toward stabilization in the east Asian economies is encouraging, clearly those economies are not out of the woods, as recent events attest. Mr. Greenspan was testifying before a Congressional committee which is considering increased _U_S funding of the International Monetary Fund. He strongly supports the increased funding.

 The number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits moved up slightly last week. However, economists say, the overall _U_S job market remains strong with labor shortages continuing in some areas.

 Voters in Northern Ireland and the Irish republic have been deciding today whether to approve a joint peace agreement, an agreement that has been called an ambitious plan to rewrite history and to put an end to sectarian bloodshed. In Northern Ireland, acceptance of the agreement will mean a different system of government. Although Northern Ireland would remain part of the United Kingdom, it would be governed by a Northern Ireland assembly and a cabinet of Northern Ireland and cooperate with the Republic of Ireland in a north south ministerial council. Andre ^Denesnera is in Belfast where he's covering the vote. He's on the line with us now. Andre, we understand polls have just closed in Northern Ireland. We know there are no results yet, but can you tell us what kind of turnout there's been today? Yes. Well, i it appears that uh there is going to be a very, or has been a very heavy voter turnout. One election official told me it's the largest turnout he's seen in his district in over thirty years. And other officials are talking about an eighty percent turnout. So when you think there are about one point two million uh voters here in northern Ireland, eighty percent is way above any kind of uh turnout in any general election. And if you have a high turnout, uh the pundits uh say that it is a far better uh an a f far better deal for those voting yes than those who are voting no. And that would be an indication then that this is pro probably going to be a yes? Previous to this it seemed that the polls in Northern Ireland showed it would, would be accepted. Is that, that the way the day seems to be going? Yes. Uh, the, the indications are that uh all the polls have been showing that uh the agreement will be accepted. The only question is by how large a margin? And uh as well as the ^Ulster union, as tho the largest party as well as the social democratic and labor party, which is the nationalist party, have indicated that if you have a sixtyfive percent turnout or sixtyfive percent yes vote or higher, that means that the majority of the nationalists, Catholics, and the majority of the Protestants or unionists have voted for it, and that is what everyone is looking for because that will really cement the agreement and uh make it, uh make it an agreement that uh everyone can, can at least uh live with. Andre, this is Susan Clark. Uh, it seems that it's interesting that they do need that kind of majority to feel confident and comfortable. I was wondering about this. The Reverend Ian ^Paisley has campaigned very hard against this agreement, and there was a time when his opposition would have killed the possibility of approval or, or probably even an agreement. Is he marginalized? What's hap if so, what's happened to marginalize him? Well, th the uh, one has to look at oh, the, the difference between the yes campaign and the no campaign. Uh fear is, is, is a commodity in great supply here, Susan. And uh, uh there is always a fear on one side of the divide that if yes, if uh, if, if, if -f -f let's say the Catholics vote yes and the Protestants say, well, you know, this is, this might be bad for us. ^Ian, Reverend ^Ian ^Paisley and, and the no campaign have basically capitalized on that. But walking the streets of, of, of Belfast, up the ^Shankhill road, the Protestant road and the ^Falls road, the Catholic road, uh y you have a feeling that there is still this fear, but people are willing to take the chance. And they are saying, you know, uh I have children, I have, I have, I, I'm looking at the future, and maybe this will help us to, to, to um to t t bridge the sectarian divide. So to answer your question, yes, he may be marginalized. But then again I spoke to Peter Robinson, who is the number two in ^Ian ^Paisley's uh party. And, and he says even if they lose they are going to uh present candidates to this new ah assembly that you mentioned, and they will still be part of, part of the government and they will basically make sure that the agreements that uh, that the people are voting for right now uh will basically, they'll still try to uh t, still try to stop it. Some analysts have said this agreement would have been impossible earlier, and that it's only possible now because of the very different economic situation in the two Irelands. Uh, Northern Ireland used to be prosperous, the Belfast shipyard used to be very busy, but the Republic was poor, and that now the situation's reversed. Is that your observation? I think it's a simplistic way of looking at it. Of course economics plays a big role, and one has to look at uh th th simply the difference between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Ireland is not looking towards uh Northern Ireland or Britain. It's looking towards Europe. It is part of Europe. It is going that way. Northern Ireland is still in some sort of uh time warp. And uh, but one has to look at uh the time warp in the sense of, of the horrible terrorist acts that happened here. And it is very much part of, part of Northern Ireland. So yes, economics plays a role. But I think it is, it is basically people, both from the Catholic side, from Sinn Fein, and both from the unionist side, the Ulster unionists, who have basically, who have decided enough is enough. Yes, you have still terrorist groups who are on, are on the fringes, but let's make them and keep them on the fringes. And I think it is w, y you walk the streets, like I said earlier, and you have a feeling people are tired of violence. And this, this accord hopefully will pass and this will give them a chance, albeit uh uh a chance they still have to build on because nobody uh, nobody said that this will be a peace agreement. It is the foundation stone of something which might bring lasting peace to this uh, to this province. Andre, thanks very much. That was Andre Denesneras ^Denesnera who spoke to us from Belfast. Voters in the Republic of Ireland have been considering changing their constitution to renounce territorial claims to all of the island. Now they, too, would be expected to participate in the north south ministerial council and in a council of the isles. The voters in the Republic are also voting on a second question, the Amsterdam treaty Andre referred to. They are looking toward Europe. The Amsterdam treaty seeks to reform the European Union. ^Gil ^Butler has been all over the island of Ireland, bor both in the Republic and in Northern Ireland. He is in the Republic of Ireland now, in Dublin, and he is on the line with us now. ^Gil, I understand that polls in the Republic there are open for another, almost another hour. Is that correct? Uh, no, actually uh they just closed ten minutes ago. Well, excellent. Then our, our timing is better than my information. Excellent. Thank you very much. How's the turn out been? Is the referendum likely to pass? Well, I think it w not only will pass, but it will be overwhelmingly approved uh by the people here in, in uh the Republic of Ireland. Um, I talked with a group of people who had, uh were last minute voters at a polling place uh in the south central area of Dublin, and uh they came out and every single one had voted yes. And every single one gave the same reason. They want a chance for peace in Northern Ireland. Let me ask you a same question that we asked Andre. Do you think that the change in the relative economic position of the two parts of Ireland, that is that uh the Republic is more prosperous than it used to be and the n n the north is less prosperous than it used to be, do you think that's an element in what's made the agreem this agreement possible now when it wasn't before? Uh probably. And eh the other thing that I think is interesting is that the people of the Republic are more or less counting on an in what one politician called an inexorable logic of the situation uh to bring united, uh a united Ireland. Not uh, not against the will of the Northern Ireland people, but they will just see that it uh, it, it works to their advantage. The people in the Republic, by the way, don't really care much anymore about this territorial matter because they all consider themselves European. So the borders within the island of Ireland really don't matter that much anymore. Also wanted to ask you about the other vote today, um which is the Amsterdam treaty, which we've been talking about with Andre as well. Among other things, it would pave the way for _E_U expansion. A Any indication on how the vote on that's likely to go? Well, there's going to be a bigger no vote for that than there will be for the um Northern Ireland agreement. And the reason, I guess, is that uh some of the people in Ireland don't want to give up uh any more sovereignty. Uh it still is not a majority, I don't think, but it's a vocal minority. They there was a loud speaker on a, mounted on a car out in front of some of the polling places uh shouting uh that they didn't want the Amsterdam treaty and so forth, vote no, vote no, but most of the people I talked with uh had voted yes. Well, it's been a fascinating time for you to be in Ireland. Uh thanks, ^Gil. ^Gil ^Gil ^Butler spoke to us from Dublin in the Republic of Ireland.

 Indonesian students occupying the Parliament building in ^Jakarta have peacefully ended their five day occupation of the building. The students decided to move after troops moved in to take back the Parliament. _V_O_A correspondent Gary Thomas, who was in the Parliament compound when the soldiers moved in, has this report. Some two thousand students gave up their occupation of the Indonesian Parliament building after the government sent in troops to clear the area. Shortly after eleven thirty _P_M, troops suddenly showed up in force at the Parliament complex and ordered the students to leave. However, the troops did not wade into the crowd of students, but held back to give them time to debate their course of action. The students left the Parliament building itself, but some remained on the grounds in apparent defiance of the order to leave. The students had been occupying the Parliament to press their demand for the ouster of President ^Suharto and for democratic reforms. Although Mr. ^Suharto resigned Thursday, many students were not happy with his successor, President _B_J Habibiee. Gary Thomas, _V_O_A News, Jakarta. And here in Washington, the International Monetary Fund said it will send an envoy to Jakarta next week to discuss a possible resumption of the _I_M_F bail out program for Indonesia. The _I_M_F suspended millions of dollars in payments Wednesday because of the unrest there.
---------------------------
 Indonesia's new President, _B_J Habibie has toured shopping areas of ^Jakarta that were destroyed during antigovernment rioting two weeks ago. The President urged merchants who lost everything in recent riots to be calm and to rebuild. He also said the government will help. Thousands of protesters vented their anger at the state of Indonesia's economy two weeks ago by burning and looting shops owned by ethnic Chinese. Scores of people, many of them looters died in the violence. The government today released two prominent political prisoners who were granted an unconditional amnesty by President Habibie. However as _V_O_A correspondent Gary Thomas reports from ^Jakarta, one of the men still wants Mr. Habibie to step down to wa to make way for a new interim government. Labor activist ^Muchtar ^Pakpahan and dissident politician ^Sri ^Bintang ^Pamungkas were released from ^Sinpinang jail in the predawn hours Tuesday. The release came at the hands of President _B_J Habibie who became President last week when President ^Suharto abruptly bowed to public pressure and resigned. Mr. ^Bintang had been in prison for insulting President ^Suharto during a speech in Germany in nineteen ninetysix. Mr. ^Pakpahan was serving a four year jail term for allegedly inciting labor unrest. It was the first such release by the Habibie government which has pledged to institute more political reforms, including the release of additional political prisoners. The government has also promised new elections. In a meeting with a small group of reporters at his east ^Jakarta home Tuesday, Mr. ^Pakpahan said although he is grateful for his release, President Habibie should step down to make way for another interim government less tied to Mr. ^Suharto. He said Mr. Habibie should call a special session of the people's consultative assembly next month to elect a new transitional government, or he warned, there would be fresh demonstrations. If, uh, Habibie will not, uh, hold, will not agree to hold general assembly next month or, uh, next term, yeah. It is mean that he against the people need, the people interest. And it is mean will trigger the big demonstration again, next month or next week. If he will not give his positive direction to the statement, yeah we will continue to organize the demonstration. You know demonstration is our, our to insist him, to force him. Mr. ^Pakpahan said reform is rolling and nothing can stop it. He said he hopes change will come peacefully but that a recurrence of the street demonstrations may become necessary if the government balks at true and total reform. I always organize my activity depend on our opinion and our aim. Now my aim is to build the change, to reform the system. Okay, of course, we pray for the choice, uh, to bring the reformation peacefully, gradually, but if the current +against us, no another choice, better me go back to jail, then I am free, but I cannot do anything. It is my principle. Mr. ^Pakpahan said the assembly should change electoral laws so that more than just the three officially recognized political parties are allowed. He also said the law allowing the President to appoint members of the assembly should be abolished so that all assembly members are elected. Mr. ^Pakpahan said he is and will remain a trade unionist and has no plans to enter electoral politics, even when reforms are implemented. He said he must remain a voice for change. Gary Thomas, _V_O_A news, ^Jakarta.

 On Wall Street stocks fell sharply. Concern mounts that the dollar's increasing strength against the yen could harm an already anemic Asian economy. Slowing consumer demand from Asia would hurt _U_S corporate profits. The NASDAQ composite index plunged twentyseven points to seventeen seventyeight. In London merger speculation lifted key stock indices. The publisher of Britain's number two tabloid, ^Mirror Group, could get an offer from Germany's ^Axle ^Springer ^Verlag by week's end. The financial times one hundred index benefited from the positive sentiment sparked by the merger hopeful. The ^FTSE gained fifteen points to fiftynine seventy. Precious metals suffered, easing prices. London gold lost a dollar eightyfive cents to two hundred ninetyseven dollars. Japanese shares finished higher boosted by exporter's stock as the _U_S dollar rises versus the yen. The ^Nikkei average jumped one hundred one points to end just shy of sixteen thousand. Rising borrowing costs slammed banks and property developers in Hong Kong. The ^Hang ^Seng index lost sixtytwo points by the closing bell to a level of nine thousand four hundred eightytwo.

 Thailand has admitted in a letter to the International Monetary Fund that its economy is in worse shape than had been expected. The letter approved by the Thai cabinet Tuesday says the economy may shrink by as much as five and a half percent as compared with an earlier estimate of three point five percent.

 In South Korea, nationwide strikes, the weak Japanese yen, and fears of another financial crisis are weighing heavily on that country's economy. While the government in Seoul is seen as moving in the right direction, analysts see more economic pain ahead for South Korea, at least in the short term. Amy ^Bickers reports from the _V_O_A Asia News Center. As tens of thousands of Korean workers went on strike Wednesday, stock market investors kept up their own protest of sorts. Early in the session, the benchmark composite index dropped to a new eleven year low. It edged slightly higher by the close as small investors took advantage of bargain basement prices, but, as Singapore based economist William ^Overhalt of the Bank of Boston warns, the market will probably remain depressed for weeks. The labor strikes raised uh investor fears that the reform process might be set back ah in addition to the obvious concern that corporate earnings might be hurt. While union leaders are demanding more unemployment benefits and a speedy restructuring of the nation's bloated conglomerates, Mr. ^Overhalt says domestic and international investors fear those demands could cripple the country's corporate sector. Analyst William ^Hunsaker of Investment Bank _I_N_G Bering's Seoul office agrees. He believes some of South Korea's largest companies could be vulnerable to a further selloff. The stocks that will be hit will be those that are involved in, in the labor disputes, the auto makers or shipbuilders or heavy industry, because that's where most of the labor union is focused. Neither Mr. ^Hunsaker nor Mr. ^Overhalt see a quick way out of the crisis. They point out while workers are striking for more benefits, the country does not really have an established social welfare system to take care of the unemployed. And the government can hardly say no to the coming layoffs. Reforming the nation's inefficient industries is one of the key conditions set by the International Monetary Fund. It bailed out the country last December with a record fiftyeight billion dollar program, and meets on Friday in Washington to approve the next installment of two billion dollars in loans to Seoul. Amy ^Bickers for _V_O_A News, Hong Kong.

 And the Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League shut down the mighty Detroit offense to even their Western Conference final playoff series at one game apiece. Goalie Ed ^Belfor made twenty seven saves as the Stars rebounded from an opening game shutout to hand the visiting Red Wings a three to one defeat. The Stars clinched the game with just eleven seconds left when ^Guy ^Carbino fired the puck into an empty net after Detroit pulled its goalie. ^Belfor says he hopes the Stars can win in Detroit. T my job is to play hard. And uh, you know, I like to play my best. And, you know, I that's my job, and I take pride in it. And ah, you know, I'm going to go there and try to play the best I can. And if we're playing as a team right from the out, uh you know, I think we'll be successful. The Red Wings had won six straight playoff games on the road. They'll now get a chance to play before their home crowd as the series moves to Detroit for game three on Friday night.

 NATO foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg have agreed on measures to support Albania and Macedonia against a spillover of the conflict in Kosovo. _V_O_A's Ron ^Pemstein reports from Luxembourg. Russia agrees with NATO on the short term, but has questions about the longterm planning. The NATO foreign ministers have asked their military authorities to develop contingency plans by the end of June for NATO troops to help Albania and Macedonia if the violence in Kosovo gets out of control. In the meantime, the ministers offer the two countries increased training and advice to help their armed forces secure their borders. Secretary of state ^Madeleine Albright explains the limited steps. The point is to clarify our options so that our leaders can make decisions. If and when it becomes necessary to act, NATO will be ready. Russian foreign minister ^Yevgeni ^Primakov, here for the NATO Russia council, says he supports training local forces to patrol Kosovo's borders. Mr. ^Primakov says if NATO sends troops, the United Nations security council should approve it. American officials disagree. Ron ^Pemstein, _V_O_A news, Luxembourg.

 Tennis anyone? That's right, Don. A little soggy, though, out there on the courts in Paris. Two rain delays disrupted play Thursday at the French Open tennis tournament in Paris, which is the second major tournament of the year. ^Tomas ^Enquist of Sweden, however, managed to defeat former champion, ^Yevgeni ^Kapelnikov of Russia in between the raindrops in four sets. ^Cedir ^Pealy of France did the same. He hit past countryman Julian ^Buterre, also in four sets. Former world number one, ^Tomas ^Muster of Austria scored a straight sets win over Germany's Nicholas ^Keefer to reach the third round. Among the women, former champion ^Arancia ^Sanchez ^Vicario of Spain took a straight sets victory over ^Katalina ^Krystaya of Romania. Second seed ^Lindsey Davenport of the United States needed only fiftyone minutes to get past South African qualifier ^Liselle ^Horn, six two, six love. Davenport describes what she did during her rain delay. I read a magazine, had a little bit, uh, of a book, and, uh, it went by pretty fast, surprisingly. So it was good. Eleventh seed and crowd favorite, Mary ^Pierce of France didn't have such a good day, however. She squandered two set points in the first set, and then fell to unheralded Spaniard ^Maggie ^Cerna, seven five, six two. ^Pierce says her game just did not match her opponent's. I think she played really deep and, uh, you know, I was trying maybe to do too much with the ball and a little too impatient and, uh, you know, I think that, ah, she just played a little bit better than me, I guess. Young Russian star, Anna ^Kornikova, says she was confident of winning, despite a second set scare against ^Katarina ^Studanikova of Slovakia. I think, you know, I played very well in the first set and she probably had little chance and little too many mistakes, but in the second, you know, she probably adjusted to my game and I started, uh, probably going for too much. But, uh, I, even you know, when I was down five four or something like that in the second set, I was confident, uh. I knew that, you know, I'm playing well. American ^Chanda ^Rubin was also a winner, defeating ^Tatiana ^Panova of Russia.

 Speaking of Scotland, Scotland's team is here in the nation's capital to take on the _U_S soccer team Saturday in a World Cup warm up match. The _U_S team has been creating lots of scoring chances recently, but Coach Sampson says they need to convert them against Scotland. I think it is important that we play well this weekend and that we do play to win, uh, that we finish our chances, uh, because, uh, with the win, uh, and if we play well, we can take that confidence going into the World Cup. Coach Sampson added that if his players tie or lose to Scotland Saturday but still play well, that should also help their confidence heading into the World Cup. The _U_S soccer team is the last of the thirtytwo teams to play its opening match at the World Cup. The Americans take on Germany June fifteenth in Paris. And that's it for sports extra.

 In a shocking move, Brazil's national football team has left forward ^Homario, a hero of the nineteen ninetyfour World Cup, off its squad for this month's tournament in France. The forward was not ready to play because he has not recovered from a nagging leg muscle injury. Team doctors said the decision to drop ^Homario was made after a scan showed swelling in the muscle. Brazilian coach Mario ^Zigalo has named defensive midfielder, ^Emerson ^Ferera, as ^Homario's replacement.

 Indonesia's most respected human rights body has added its voice to calls for the release of political prisoners from the Suharto era. The National Commission on Human Rights made its appeal Tuesday. The government of new president _B_J Habibiee released four prisoners of conscience after President Suharto resigned last month, but dozens more remain behind bars. The Habibiee government says it will gradually release or pardon all those detained for insulting Mr. Suharto.

 Mr. Clinton also announced he was extending most favored nation trading status to China, calling Beijing's cooperation in trying to defuse the south Asian nuclear crisis an important example of how _U_S engagement with China serves America's interests. Under _U_S law, China's trading privileges must be determined each year and the _U_S Congress has ninety days in which it can vote to override the president's decision to renew _M_F_N. Mr. Clinton described how trade with China had an impact on Beijing. Trade is a force for change in China, exposing China to our ideas and our ideals and integrating China into the global economy. The president said that a constructive relationship with China had made improvements in Beijing's human rights record.

 A group of _U_S politicians is calling for a twentyfive percent increase in the _U_S contribution to the International Fund for Ireland. The group says it will push for the increase as a show of support for voters in the Irish Republic and British ruled Northern Ireland who overwhelmingly approved a peace plan for Northern Ireland last month. _V_O_A's John ^Pitman has details from Washington. The group pushing for the increase is led by Democratic Senator Robert ^Toracelli and Republican Senator ^Alphonse ^D'Amato. At a news conference on Thursday, Senator ^Toracelli said the victory of the yes vote in last month's referendum was an extraordinary step toward peace, but he added that for the peace process to succeed, the Irish will need help resolving the economic inequalities which exist in the British province. Senator ^Toracelli said the importance of economic development, especially in Catholic sections of Northern Ireland, cannot be underestimated. He said the goal of increasing the _U_S contribution should be to spark economic growth and help create jobs in Northern Ireland, which has one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe. The United States currently contributes nineteen point six million dollars to the International Fund for Ireland. John ^Pitman, _V_O_A News, Washington.

 Ethnic Albanian leaders in Serbia's Kosovo province have announced the suspension of Friday's talks with Belgrade authorities. As violence spreads in Kosovo. ^Thami ^Agami a top advisor to Kosovo ethnic Albanian leader ^Ibrahim ^Rugova told _V_O_A the talks in Belgrade are being suspended because the escalation of fighting makes them meaningless. He demanded third party mediation in setting an agenda for future talks.

 Chris ^Stills is a new voice on the music scene. But he's been a part of it for quite a while. His father is rock and roll hall of famer and his mother is a French songstress, but in the American record business, it takes more than a solid family tree to make a successful first album. As _V_O_A's ^Katherine Cole reports, his lineage is certainly in evidence on this promising debut recording. But twentythree yearold Chris ^Stills is clearly cutting his own path. While he is the son of world famous rock star Steven ^Stills, Chris ^Stills did not grow up on the road going from concert to concert with his dad and hanging out backstage. In fact, he thinks of himself as something of an outsider because while he was raised in California, Chris ^Stills was educated in Paris. And he traveled the world before coming back to the United States. His father tried to dissuade his son from following in his musical footsteps, but it didn't work. As they say, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Check out the harmonies on this song, desert sands. Word of God come touch my hand why did you keep me sleeping boy it must make you understand devils running in the desert sand is this darkness that I see before me darkness before me devils running in the desert sand singing That is Chris ^Stills with desert sands from his debut _C_D one hundred year thing. While he comes from a musical family, _D_N_A alone can't make a hit. Sales of his recordings and popularity will determine whether the younger ^Stills has what it takes to deliver an entire album of compelling songs. At this point in his young career, Chris ^Stills' songwriting is more polished than his singing. His lyrics are confident but his voice still is gaining its own character. This is quite a respectable debut album, one that should appeal to a variety of musical tastes. Take a listen to the guitar sizzle on God won't make you a man. So you see I walk alone, carry the pieces of my bittersweet song. Holy faith trust in only one yeah and imagination, my heart is breaking, hear my call, kingdom come, come on show me tomorrow, better see if you can my mom always used to tell me, god won't make you a man right on through to that place where you know that you care like a cold sweat I ooze up from beneath the bitter earth, crawling up slowly to discover my own universe, as I see this horrible side I just want to die. I know that Jesus Christ gave me the strength to stay alive. Do you hear a certain family resemblance to his dad's efforts with the group ^Crosby ^Stills, and ^Nash? That's Chris ^Stills, son of ^Stephen, singing God won't make you a man off his new _C_D one hundred year thing. Just a year ago Chris was working as a roadie lugging his dad's guitars onstage. It's going to be interesting to see where he'll be ten years down the road. I'm ^Katherine Cole.

 Well, the Utah Jazz will try to make it two straight wins over Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls Friday night in game two of the best of seven National Basketball Association championship series. The host Jazz won the first game Wednesday in overtime, eightyeight, eightyfive, as the Bulls lost their fourth straight road game in the playoffs. Chicago star guard Michael Jordan says the Bulls are philosophical about the loss. I think we have an inner strength, inner confidence about ourselves and what we're capable of accomplishing. And one game does not deteriorate that. Uh, sure it's a pressure situation, it's the ultimate, or the apex of the season. And um you don't fight the apex of the season with frustrations an and anger. After game two in Salt Lake City, the series moves to Chicago beginning Sunday for games three and four and if necessary, game five. Any other games would be played on Utah's home court. The Bulls are looking for their fifth _N_B_A championship in the last seven seasons. Michael Jordan was not with the team during the years Chicago failed to win the title.

 The remake of a nineteen fifties movie featuring an ugly looking creature that creates havoc in New York City sits atop the list of the top five movies in the United States this week. I don't want to keep the suspense going, here's entertainment reporter ^Alan Silverman in Hollywood. Thing's only two hundred miles off the eastern American seaboard, and we don't even know what the hell it is What is it? It's a limping lizard. That's the nickname show business columnists give the monster movie that remains the box office champion, but is not doing nearly the business its producers had hoped for. The one new entry among the top five films this week is a simple romance that almost toppled the special effect filled saga. Meanwhile an outrageous political fable is held over at number five Democratic party don't care about the African American community. Isn't that obvious? Hey, you've got half of your kids out of work and the other half are in jail. Do you see any democrat doing anything about it? So what are you going to do, vote republican? In ^Bull ^Worth, Warren ^Beatty plays a fictitious _U_S senator who suffers a nervous breakdown and starts cutting through all the political rhetoric with a startling burst of truth. ^Beatty admits he too is using the system to get his message across. Our free speech is not free. It's very expensive speech and uh I get to say all of this because a very large corporation would like to make some money out of this movie, and because your corporation would like to s make some money out of this process. So I have the opportunity to say it. And there's not one of us that's not involved in the system. ^Beatty also cowrote and directs ^Bull ^Worth which costars ^Halley ^Barry and is in fifth place. Dropping to number four, a saga of romance and horses in the vanishing American west. You got to figure out what you want. Do you know what you want? I do know what I want and I'm trying real hard not to get lost in this. Robert Redford stars as the Horse Whisperer, a solitary man with a gift for understanding horses. ^Kristen ^Scott Thomas costars as a headstrong New Yorker who needs his help after a tragic riding accident and who falls in love with him along the way. I think it is about faith and trust and being able to to lean on people. And, that's something that is important in the film. It's the story about trusting your love for your parents, and trusting your love for your spouse and trusting your love for your daughter and you know, I think those a those are good things to have in films. The more I try and fix things, the more everything falls apart. You should let him fall. The adaption of the hit novel by Nicholas Evans is also directed by Redford and the Horse Whisperer trots along in fourth place. Congratulations, you now have the biggest story in history. Slipping to number three, Deep Impact. With a comet on a collision course for earth, when astronauts cannot deflect it the planet faces the prospect of annihilation. Morgan Freeman stars as the _U_S President, with ^Tea ^Leone as a _T_V reporter who uncovers the story. Deep Impact slips to third place, pushed down by a new romance entering the chart at number two. I really don't want you to kiss me right now. Who said anything about kissing? Hope Floats stars Sandra ^Bullock as a former cheerleader who returns to her Texas hometown to start her life over again with fewer or at least with different mistakes. The director is ^Forrest ^Whittaker, and star ^Bullock is also the executive producer. I like the producing right now a great deal more than I do the acting. I'm better at it right now because I have more to to give in that depar. Because a lot of it is administrative, damage control, creative thinking, who to put in, what personalities will work best together. It's like there's a sense of panic and y n y never if one thing falls out, the whole thing could fall apart. There's this rush to it. As an actor, you don't get to do that that much. And I'm not that good. One day I hope to be that good, but I'm not that good yet. Every, every film I do I get better. But that's also because I'm learning to surround myself with people that are far better than I am where I can like a sponge suck the life out of it and take that away. You think life goes on forever? You think behind every chance there's another chance and another one and another one? Hope Floats also features ^Jenna ^Rolands and Harry ^Connick Junior and the romantic drama opens up in second place, just barely edged out by the scifi adventure held over at number one. Well, we know that he eats tons of fish. He's amphibious and he's pregnant In Godzilla, the Independence Day team of writer producer ^Dean ^Devlan and director Roland ^Emerick update the venerable Japanese movie monster, a mutant caused by radioactivity, and send him on a destructive visit to New York City. And for the second straight week, Godzilla is the most popular movie at North American theaters. ^Alan Silverman for the Voice of America in Hollywood.

 World cup continues in France. Steve, what can we say at this point? Well, uh the action is over for today, Tom. As a matter of fact, uh two games were completed. Both of them ended up in draws in group _B. _V_O_A's Jim Stevenson is part of our team coverage of the world cup in France and has this live report. Jim? Well, Steve, uh you're absolutely right. ^Cameroon and Austria were two of those teams. They spent much of their contest in ^Toulouse playing defense and mounting tentative offensive attacks. But as the scoreless contest came to the closing minutes of the second half, the scoring threats became more intense. finally got ^Cameroon on the scoreboard with beautiful fakes on two Austrian defenders before punching the ball into the net just outside of the box in the seventyseventh minute. But ^Cameroon's celebration was short lived as Anton scored the equalizer for Austria during injury time, finishing that game in a one goal draw. Chile and Italy also ended in a tie in the earlier group _B match which was played in ^Bordeaux. ^Christian ^Viari put the Italians up early in the tenth minute before ^Marcello ^Salas booted the first of his two quick goals in the fortyeighth and fiftieth minutes. Then five minutes from time, the ball hit the hand of Chile's ^Renaldo ^Fuentes. Officials saw it. That prompted a penalty kick by Italian Roberto ^Bogio. The shot scooted down into the left side of the net. And that game ended tied at two goals each. Coming up next, all four group _C teams will be on the field later Friday. Saudi Arabia plays Denmark in ^Lyons while fans in the southern resort of Marseilles will watch host France meet South Africa, and in nearby ^Montpelier group _D entries Paraguay and Bulgaria will open their world cup final campaign. Steve?

 A jury in the state of Florida has found cigarette maker Brown and Williamson liable in the death of a long time smoker and awarded his family a half million dollars in damages. The family of ^Roland ^Maddox claimed he contracted lung cancer in nineteen ninetysix, after smoking Lucky Strike cigarettes for almost fifty years. He died a year later at the age of sixtyseven. The jurors agreed with the family Wednesday that Brown and Williamson was negligent and made a defective product and plotted with other tobacco companies to hide the health risks of smoking from the public. Richard ^Danard is a law professor at Northeastern University in Boston where he's with the Tobacco Products Liability Project. He told _V_O_A's Kent ^Klein why he thinks the jury held the tobacco company responsible. I think part of it is that uh uh ^Woody ^Wilner, the plaintiff attorney, uh began by saying, yes, he he is uh, or his family is acknowledging his responsibility uh for uh continuing to smoke uh. We want you to consider that responsibility in figuring out what a fair verdict is. uh The tobacco companies, by the way, are, uh, as a procedural matter, hate the notion of uh having the jury balance the uh ah responsibility of the smoker for continuing to smoke, for failing to succeed in his, you know, uh efforts to quit, uh against that of the tobacco companies. Because once you compare the two, you have a, you know, sort of a mouse versus an elephant. That uh, you know, I'm sure uh, you know, smokers uh, you know, should try to quit as hard as they can and you can put some level of blame uh on them when they uh fail to do it. But when you compare that with the deliberate misbehavior of the tobacco companies where they know very well what the uh, ah what the adverse consequences are going to be. They uh ah know that if you don't get people starting as kids or teenagers, they're not going to start smoking. uh They knew the dangers and they lied about it. And when the jury puts the two side by side, uh I think it becomes a pretty easy uh case for the plaintiff. Does this open the door for a lot more big money lawsuits against the tobacco companies? And and if there are more, will they have uh a good chance of winning? Oh, I think it, sure, I think it opens the door to, uh you know, presumably, you know, thousands or tens of thousands or more cases against the companies uh because uh ah there is so many people who are in the position of uh Mr. ^Maddox and his, a and his family, unfortunately. They, uh ah their, you know, it happens all around the United States, it obviously happens all around the world. And we're beginning to see it uh not only elsewhere in the _U_S, but we're beginning to see uh these cases uh come up in uh ah different parts of the uh of the world as well. So uh ah I think, uh I think this does is the open door. I think there's, there was enough money in this case to, uh you know, encourage lawyers to bring them. Because lawyers, at least in the United States, work on the contingency fee basis, so if they don't win, they don't get anything. And uh ah this was a substantial win and uh ah it means there's, you know, enough money in pursuing this line of work to uh ah attract uh many competent lawyers uh around the country and perhaps around the world. Law Professor Richard ^Danard is with the Tobacco Products Liability Project at Northeastern University in Boston.

 At this hour, we are also watching the violence unfolding along the Ethiopian ^Eritrean border. Ethiopian troops in the north are on alert following an ^Eritrean bombing raid Thursday. _V_O_A's correspondent ^Scott ^Stearns is at the front and finds more and more civilians are fleeing the area. From a lookout high in the rocky hills of northern ^Tigray, Ethiopian soldiers watch the border town of ^Zallambasa. It was captured by ^Eritrean troops two weeks ago. Ethiopia has been reinforcing positions along this ridge ever since. Soviet _T fiftyfive tanks and a battery of a hundred and thirty millimeter field guns anchor an Ethiopian line less than five kilometers from ^Eritrean trenches. Two soldiers clean a ^Katusha mobile rocket launcher as a boy passes by herding goats through the dust. The ^Eritreans won considerable ground with the surprise of their attack in ^Zallambasa and across northern Ethiopia. Since then, they've made less progress finding Ethiopian soldiers instead of border police. Colonel ^Ephram ^Bangee says the ^Eritreans have tried to come up the Hill from ^Zallambasa five times in the last two weeks. He says his men have punished them harder every time they've tried. Because ^Eritrea has opened the war of aggression, colonel ^Ephram says, Ethiopians must defend their sovereignty. That's the army's only aim, he says. We are prepared. We are ready and we're doing it. Colonel ^Ephram's antiaircraft guns watch for ^Eritrean bombing raids in the clear blue northern sky. Thursday, the guns were not enough, not enough to defend the sovereignty though the people of ^Adigrat thirtyfive kilometers farther south. ^Eritrean attack helicopters and jets bombed ^Adigrat narrowly missing the church and the pharmaceutical factory, destroying the grain warehouse. Rescue workers clear twisted metal roofing sheets from piles of smoldering sorghum. Blasted cans of cooking oil, torn plastic food sacks melted in the heat of more than seven hours of fire. Three people were killed by cluster bombs in the warehouse courtyard. A fourth in a small stone house just over the wall. ^Nesgenet ^Kedesay was hit in the side of her head with shrapnel. ^Nesgenet says she was too shocked to think about what was happening, just shocked. She saw herself lying on the ground and people running around outside the warehouse. The food there was being used to help feed more than ten thousand people who fled the fighting in ^Zallambasa. Now many are moving farther south away from the front toward the city of Mekele which was bombed a week ago. Across Ethiopian society from bank workers to farmers, even political opponents, people are rallying behind the government's recent hard line against the ^Eritreans. Privately they say Ethiopia's army should have moved faster to put down the threat. Colonel ^Ephram says it's tactics and experience that shaped the military response, not the passion of immediate retaliation. Colonel ^Ephram says Ethiopia will not follow the beacon of the enemy in being drawn to retaliate immediately. He says, we have our own ways. We plan our own way and we do it when we're ready. Ethiopian Prime Minister ^Mela ^Zenoli says he's run out of patience with ^Eritrea. While he still supports the _U_S Rwandan peace plan, the Prime Minister says where ^Eritrea is concerned, enough is enough. ^Scott ^Stearns, _V_O_A news on the Ethiopian ^Eritrean border.

 The United Nations has criticized the ^Taleban's decision to close private schools and training programs for females in the Afghan capital Kabul. The measure, announced Tuesday, effects more than one hundred facilities, some which were supported by foreign aid agencies. _U_N officials say it will devastate the welfare of many of the poorest people in the Afghan capital. Here's the _U_N Sarah Russelll. If this trend continues, uh, it's, uh, ve it's, it's very ominous that the way, for the way we can actually help the women and girls of Afghanistan who, who need our help. ^Taleban authorities say the schools and training programs were unIslamic.

 When it comes to food safety, several words trigger heated debate among Americans, including ^Olestra. That's a noncaloric synthetic fat substitute which brings the taste of fat, but none of its calories, to snack foods like potato chips. The government's Food and Drug Administration approved ^Olestra in nineteen ninetysix, and last week held hearings to reevaluate this unusual product. The conclusion? ^Olestra continues to be safe. Marilyn ^Sylvie attended the hearings, and has a report. When the Food and Drug Administration, the _F_D_A, originally approved use of ^Olestra it knew the fat substitute can cause stomach cramps, and diarrhea. And it knew that ^Olestra can absorb and remove from one's body vitamins obtained from fruits and vegetables. So, the _F_D_A told companies planning to make products with ^Olestra to put warning labels on them, cautioning diet conscious consumers of potential problems from ^Olestra. And the government set a review of ^Olestra to be held after two and a half years by a citizens advisory committee of twentyfive nutrition experts, most of them university professors. This week, that committee gathered in Reston, Virginia, for that review, and heard four and a half days of testimony about ^Olestra's effects. The _F_D_A's Joseph ^Levitt, who is director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, called the committee's conclusions good news for consumers. It was general agreement from the advisory committee members that there were no new data or other information that raised significant new public health concerns. However, there was no agreement about the present labeling system to caution consumers about potential problems with ^Olestra. Some committee members said the label should include more information, such as a warning not to eat ^Olestra products with fruits and vegetables. Other members urged that the label be moved from the back of product packages to the front. And most thought a toll free telephone number should be added to the label to make it easier for consumers to contact the manufacturer. A few people thought the label should be removed altogether. ^Proctor and Gamble is one of three _U_S companies marketing foods made with ^Olestra yet uses it under the trademark of ^Olene in Pringles potato chips. Sharon ^Mitchell, the company's vice president for research and development was very pleased with the advisory committee's report. We're delighted with the outcome. Uh, this week, ^Olene had its thirty month checkup, and it passed with flying colors. We're looking forward to giving consumers what they've asked for. Fatfree snacks that taste great, that have no fat, and half the calories. But not everyone was happy. If we had our way, we would get rid of ^Olestra from the food supply. Michael ^Jacobson directs the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an independent, nonprofit consumer organization in Washington, _D_C. I'm disappointed that the committee gave, uh, little credence to older studies, and to the nine thousand reports of adverse effects due to ^Olestra. I think they were swayed by some of ^Proctor and Gamble's newer studies that pretty much gave the result that was expected. Uh, when people eat small amounts of ^Olestra they have relatively small e effects. The, uh, unfortunate thing is that many people will experience severe gastrointestinal symptoms because they innocently eat ^Olestra probably in a vain effort to lose weight, or, or cut their fat intake. Uh, we have real foods in supermarkets, and that's what people should be eating. While the advisory committee ma a good report card to ^Olestra it's not the final examination for the controversial food additive, which one member of the committee, epidemiology prof Henry Blackburn of the University of -nesota called, the most synthetic food product we've ever been exposed to in the course of human evolution. Next, the Food and Drug Administration will debate possible to labels on foods containing ^Olestra. And the _F_D_A's Joseph ^Levitt promised the Agency will continue to monitor ^Olestra as the committee unanimously requested. I'm Marilyn ^Sylvie.

 Hong Kong's government received a generally positive reaction to a package of economic measures it unveiled Monday. As Amy ^Bickers reports, economists are hopeful the four billion dollar package will save the territory's troubled economy from a fullblown confidence crisis. Hong Kong chief executive ^Tung ^Cheehwa announced a series of measures to restore consumer confidence and ease the credit crunch now gripping the Chinese territory. The steps include the halting of government land sales until March, a variety of tax cuts, and a freeze in government salaries. Economist Vanessa ^Yung of ^Je ^Kae ^Go securities in Hong Kong cautiously welcomes the package. I think that in general it's a good sign. Its, it shows that the government has strong determination to support the economy and the property market. Uh, I think the only problem is whether it's sufficient or not. And also are there any more things we can do accept for fiscal policies. Fiscal policy is the only economic tool for Hong Kong's government. Hong Kong has stuck with high interest rates to defend its currency's ^Peg to the _U_S dollar, so the government cannot lower interest rates to stimulate spending. Monday's move was Mr. ^Tung's first attempt to moderate a forty percent plunge in property prices from their peak last year. The government will effectively freeze real estate prices at current levels. Critics describe it as interventionist. Ms. ^Yung disagrees. I think that this measures, uh, withholding land sales, etcetera, is actually indicating a more flexibility of the government. Land sales policies and also the, uh, housing supply policy in according to the current economic situation. I think that actually shows more flexibility or, or, uh, a more market oriented system. I don't think that actually means, eh, more interventionist. I think this is actually more freehanded approach. Michael ^Green, property analyst for investment bank ^Solomon Smith ^Barney in Hong Kong agrees. He says thousands of Hong Kong people will be able to buy flats, thanks to low interest rate loans now available to first time home buyers. I think the government measures are, are very good for stabilization. The benefit of this, of course, is that a large amount of capital will be able to remain in the private sector instead of finding its way in government coffers which should add to liquidity in the private sector. Mr. ^Tung himself acknowledges that no amount of economic stimulus will pull Hong Kong out of this downturn. He confirmed Monday that Hong Kong was headed for recession. The hope is that stable property prices will stop local banks from failing, and that a confidence crisis will be averted. Amy ^Bickers for _V_O_A news, Hong Kong.

 China's human rights record has dominated much of the debate about Mr. Clinton's trip in recent weeks. Especially his agreement to be welcomed in Tiananmen Square. That's the site of the nineteen eightynine massacre. And also about Mr. Clinton's refusal to meet with dissidents while in China. But there's also a lot of controversy about the apparent provision of missile technology to China by Clinton campaign donors. _V_O_A's Roger ^Wilkison reports from Beijing, it frames an ongoing debate over America's military relations with China. A debate between hawks and doves among defense strategists and theoreticians in both countries is taking place at the same time as Beijing and Washington step up military exchanges, and identify common interests, such as avoiding tension on the Korean peninsula. Tensions over Taiwan in nineteen ninetyfive and nineteen ninetysix, when the United States deployed aircraft carriers in the area, after China launched missiles near the island, have also prompted a search for better understanding. Paul ^Beaver, an analyst with the respected Jane's Defense Publications in London, thinks that deployment caused the Chinese military to think twice about using force to capture the island they regard as a renegade province, at least for the foreseeable future. I think that the, uh, the Chinese believe, then, that uh the Americans have the capability of, uh, rushing aircraft carriers to the area. They didn't believe that they would actually have the political will to do it. It made them reexamine, for example, any plans they may have had for causing a, uh, a naval blockade of Taiwan. But _U_S defense analysts say Chinese military studies continue to portray the United States as a superpower in decline, with a gradually eroding commitment to defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack. The analysts say those studies also conclude that _U_S high tech military capabilities are vulnerable to attack by electronic sabotage. But the analysts say that essays by senior Chinese officers suggest their views are medium to long term. And that they see America's decline coming two or three decades from now. Mr. ^Beaver says Chinese military thinkers are divided on whether or not they see the Americans as rivals in the years ahead. The Chinese, I think, are probably split on how they see the Americans in the future. There is a party which would look upon the Americans as being a diminishing, a, a, a diminishing presence in, in, Asia, uh, in, two decades time. Uh, there is perhaps there majority who believe, and I think as I believe, that the United States is committed to Asia probably more than it's committed to Europe. Mr. ^Beaver says that without an American presence, there would be a lack of stability in the region. He says that if China tries to fill the vacuum, so will Japan. China expert David ^Shambaugh, a professor at George Washington University, says that even today, it is difficult to know just what the Chinese military are thinking. But he suggests they still may be misreading _U_S intentions. I don't think the Chinese underestimate American military power. I think they do underestimate American will, uh, to use force in certain situations. Singapore's ^Straits Times newspaper recently quoted an unnamed Chinese commander as saying his country is confident in its ability to seize Taiwan as soon as the United States fades from the picture. But he is also quoted as saying a decline in Washington's support for Taiwan will eventually force the island into peaceful negotiations on reunification. According to China scholar Michael ^Ochsenberg of Stanford University, Taiwan is the most serious problem in SinoAmerican relations. I do think there is a danger that some Chinese may underestimate American will on the Taiwan issue. The deep sense of obligation that the American people feel toward the twenty million people on Taiwan. And, of course, the legal obligation that any Administration has toward Taiwan, as a result of the Taiwan Relations Act. That nineteen seventynine law requires the _U_S government to come to Taiwan's aide in case it is attacked, and also allows Washington to supply socalled defensive weapons to the island. _U_S Chinese agreements call for the gradual reduction and eventual elimination of such transfers. And China says it will press President Clinton to publicly promise to live up to those accords, during his upcoming visit to China. _U_S diplomats say Washington has privately told both sides that it will not help Taiwan if the island declares its outright independence. But that it will stand by Taipei if China attacks without provocation. Roger ^Wilkison, _V_O_A News, Beijing.

 President Clinton's trip to China is getting lots of media attention but he's certainly not the only traveler there. China is a major tourist destination these days, and a new report predicts that by the year twenty twenty China will be the most visited country in the world. Marilyn ^Sylvie has details. Tourism is already the world's largest industry, but the international travel boom may be just beginning. The number of tourists is expected to more than triple by the year twenty twenty from five hundred million to one point six billion, with China expected to become the world's number one destination. Several other countries are also expected to move up rapidly on the destination list, including Russia and other republics of the former _U_S_S_R, the Czech republic, Thailand, Singapore, and South Africa. Those are conclusions of a study conducted by the World Tourism Organization or _W_T_O, which is part of the United Nations and is headquartered in Madrid. Currently France is the world's most visited country, followed by the United States, Spain, and Italy. _W_T_O secretary general ^Francesco ^Frangiali explains that China's expected rise is due to a change in the type of visitors going there. At the time being, China, uh, receives, eh, a lot of visitors from Asia, who most of them, uh, being over sea Chinese from Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, or the, uh, Chinese communities, uh, all over Asia which are visitors, uh, of the continent. What will happen with, with China is that, uh, the number of +nonoriental travelers from, uh, Europe and from North America will increase a lot and also that countries such as, uh, Thailand or Malaysia will become generating markets and not only for the small Chinese communities. This is the reason why, uh, China will be, will play this role, and also because they have a, a tremendous potential in terms of nature, culture, and, and history. Mr. ^Frangiali says the World Tourism Organization is helping China develop a number of tourist sites including ski resorts in the north and new resorts in ^Szechuan province. The World Tourism Organization study also predicts that by twenty twenty China will rise to number four on the list of countries of origin of international travelers. The present top three Germany, Japan, and the United States, are expected to remain in those positions. However, Mr. ^Frangiali says the economic crisis in some Asian countries is currently slowing overall tourism both to and from Asia. We have conducted a, a very precise survey in that last year the gross, eh, in uh Asia Pacifics was exactly zero. Mr. ^Frangiali expects the decrease in Asian tourism to be felt until the year two thousand and to result in the loss of twelve million visitors to the region. The World Tourism Organization report says one of the key factors in the development of tourism anywhere is the way potential travelers view conditions of personal safety and health. The report warns that water shortages are likely to have serious implications for tourism in north Africa, the Middle East, and south Asia in the next twentyfive years, and it points out that different types of pollution especially in Indonesia and neighboring Asian countries and in Brazil have recently affected the flow of tourists there. The United Nations has a program to help developing countries increase tourism and Mr. ^Frangiali says most of those countries now realize the potential economic importance of tourism. I think that most of them, they, they understand that, and in spite of the difficulties, they are able to, to respond to these, uh, changes. If we judge by the progress with well, that they are making an and the success that they are obtaining in, uh, in attracting foreign, foreign visitors. At the request of a number of governments and nongovernmental organizations, the World Tourism Organization is currently drawing up a global code of ethics for tourism. It incorporates the rights and obligations of both tourists and host communities. Of course it's a little bit philosophical, but I think that, uh, there is really a need and a, a demand for such kind of reference. After that, it's up to the government and to the profession to apply or to find their inspiration in such a global code of ethics. Mr. ^Frangiali hopes the code will be adopted at the _W_T_O's general assembly next year in ^Santiago. I'm Marilyn ^Sylvie.

 The start of the new millennium could bring computer chaos around the world. Without major adjustments, most systems will not be able to enter the new century because their internal clocks will run out. _V_O_A's Paula ^Wolfson reports computer experts say there is no easy fix and they are warning the _U_S Congress that time is slipping away. The twentieth century will probably go down in history as the computer age. We've gone from crude adding machines to systems capable of sending data across the street or around the world in the blink of an eye. But trouble looms in the year two thousand. The computers of the twentieth century are not ready for the new millennium. They read the current year by using the last two digits only. They will not be able to cope when they read the year two thousand, seeing it instead as nineteen hundred. It seemed +like a simple problem, one that could be easily fixed by upgraded software but experts say it is extraordinarily complex and the public is in denial. A large segment of the population is waiting for Bill Gates and Microsoft to release _M_S two thousand, the millennium virus fixer. There is no millennium virus fixer. Alan Simpson has been involved for years in the creation of global communications networks. He says Americans must realize the threat posed by the so called millennium bug is very real and very serious. We're not an island insulated from the telecommunications problems of the rest of the world. We trade, we communicate, and we point nuclear missiles at each other. The potential for catastrophic miscommunication in two thousand is immense. If nothing is done, people will wake up on the first day of the new millennium and find computer related services at a standstill. Air traffic will come to a sudden halt, banking and stock market activities will cease, and international communications links will shut down. The possibilities are enormous. The Clinton Administration predicts it will cost five billion dollars just to fix _U_S government computer systems but critics charge the Administration's efforts are way behind schedule. California Republican Steve Horn is Chairman of a House Subcommittee concerned with the year two thousand computer problem. There's not enough time to do everything. There are too many problems contending for top priority. We must be careful in the selection of the most important problems. Mr. Horn predicts Congress will have to approve billions in emergency spending to get the job done. But even if the United States completes its computer adjustments on time, America cannot be complacent. It's an interdependent world warn the experts and many other countries have not even begun to deal with the millennium bug. Dan ^Steinberg is a lawyer involved with international technology issues. He says most of the information on the year two thousand computer crisis is published and disseminated in English, creating problems for many developing nations. They also have less money. This comes as no surprise. We give foreign aid to most of the world. It should be no surprise that those without sufficient funds, we're worried about funding right here in town, they can not solve their problems quickly enough. When the World Bank sent out a letter asking countries for information about their plans to deal with the millennium bug, many never replied. Telecommunications specialist Alan Simpson says the United States must take the lead on this issue at home and abroad. We must create from strong leadership an environment that the problems can and will be fixed. It is this type of environment that this country was able to mobilize its enormous resources and prepare for World War two. Mr. Simpson warns if international computer chaos occurs, the United States will be blamed. He says governments around the world will point to their American design technology and say, it's all your fault. Paula ^Wolfson, _V_O_A News, Capitol Hill.

 Australian based NewsCorp plans to create a new company by combining its _U_S film, television, and sports businesses and sell as much of it as twenty percent of it to the public. NewsCorp Chairman Rupert ^Murdoch hopes to raise an estimated three point five billion dollars and at the same time boost his company's market value. The new company or spinoff will be called Fox Group. Investors were inspired by the move, driving NewsCorp's American depository receipts up twelve percent, about three and a half dollars to a little over thirtythree dollars. NewsCorp's _A_D_R_s have risen eightyone percent in the past year.

 I'm Dave ^DeForest, _V_O_A news. The Pentagon says a _U_S warplane fired a missile at a defense site in southern Iraq. Defense secretary William ^Cohen says four British planes were on a routine mission over the Iraqi no fly zone when Iraqi radar locked on to the aircraft, signaling an intention to fire. Mr. ^Cohen described the missile firings as defensive. They're simply engaging uh in uh their own self protection, and they will continue to do that. And Mr. ^Cohen said it is yet to be determined whether the _U_S missile actually hit its target. Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations, Nizar ^Hamdoon, says his government opposes the very existence of the no fly zone. All Iraq sees the whole no fly zone concept as illegal and against international law. An Iraqi government spokesman in Baghdad called the _U_S action unjustified and aggressive.
