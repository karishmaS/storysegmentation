 Good evening. For the second time in a week, a widely recognized American figure has died when he was skiing and ran into a tree. Congressman Sonny Bono was first a songwriter in the nineteen sixties and then a popular entertainer. He was serving his second term in Congress when he died late yesterday at a ski resort on the border between California and Nevada. First, we go to Jane Clayson, who has the details of the accident. Sonny Bono was on a family vacation at the Heavenly Ski Resort when the accident happened. Early yesterday afternoon, the sixty two year old congressman left his wife and two young daughters at the top of the mountain and started down the slope alone. At some point, he veered off into this wooded area, lost control and slammed into a tree, going twenty to thirty miles per hour. Bono died instantly. His death was caused by massive head injuries due to blunt force trauma. His wife reported him missing as the lifts were closing for the day, and two hours later, the ski patrol found his body, twenty five feet from the groomed trail in an area that was not off limits. It's very common for those uh for skiers to go into that wooded area, go in and out of it um. It's not uncommon whatsoever. So it's part of the run, if you will. Sonny Bono was an advanced skier on an intermediate run, the Orion trail. And he was familiar with this popular South Lake Tahoe resort, having skied at Heavenly for more than twenty years. No one saw the accident, but conditions on the mountain were clear at the time. Initial autopsy reports indicate Bono was not under the influence of alcohol or any other substance. It just appears this was a horrible accident. Jane Clayson, _A_B_C News, South Lake Tahoe, California.
---------------------------
 But with two horrible accidents within a week involving two American personalities, a lot of people have wondered whether skiing is more dangerous than people think. Those of us who ski would say, sure, there's an element of risk, like much of life. But dangerous? No more than anything else. About the same number of people die on America's ski slopes every year, between thirty and thirtyfive. Three times as many people are killed by lightning every year. And in nineteen ninetyfive alone, eight hundred people died in bicycle accidents and seven hundred in accidents involving boats. Of the skiers who die, eightyfive percent are young men, teenagers or in their twenties. The same group most likely to die because of reckless driving. As for skiing injuries. They have actually gone down in the last twentyfive years by about fifty percent. That is primarily because of better equipment. As for wearing a helmet, many small children and racers certainly do, but the vast majority of skiers do not. Helmet sales, we are told, have gone up since Michael Kennedy was killed.
---------------------------
 On the other hand, it's turning out to be another very bad financial week for Asia. The financial assistance from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are not helping. In the last twenty four hours, the value of the Indonesian stock market has fallen by twelve percent. The Indonesian currency has lost twenty six percent of its value. In Singapore, stocks hit a five year low. In the Philippines, a four year low. And in Hong Kong, a three percent drop. More problems in ^Hong ^Kong for a place, for an economy, that many experts thought was once invincible. Here's _A_B_C's ^Jim ^Laurie. Not that long ago, before the Chinese takeover, the news about real estate here was that the sky was the limit the highest prices in the world. So when ^Wong ^Kwan spent seventy million dollars for this house, he thought it was a great deal. He sold the property to five buyers and said he'd double his money. In Hong Kong, is always belongs to the seller's market. Now with new construction under way, three of his buyers have backed out. And ^Wong ^Kwan will be lucky to break even. All across ^Hong ^Kong, the property market has crashed. ^Pamela ^Pak owns eight condominiums here. ^Pak can't find buyers. She estimates her properties, worth a hundred thirty million dollars in October, are worth only half that now. They believe ah it will be always +up going up and up ah forever. Nobody believe this any more. Of all of Asia's economies, ^Hong ^Kong is the most robust. But in the past three months, stocks have plunged, interest rates have soared and the downturn all across Asia means that people are not spending here. Hotels are only thirty percent full. You can get seventy percent discounts at the shopping malls. Three thousand dollar pearls for eight hundred dollars. A two hundred dollar wool jacket for fifty dollars. Still, there are few buyers. And at the big brokerage houses, after ten years of boom, they're talking about layoffs. I think that the mood is fairly gloomy, and I think it's not going to change for a couple of years. So for Hong Kong, it's time, as investment bankers like to say, to reposition. To either hold on tight or get out, as much of Asia goes into recession. ^Jim ^Laurie, _A_B_C News, Hong Kong.

 It was an interesting weekend in professional golf. ^Casey ^Martin, the disabled golfer we told you about last week, won the ^Lakeland Classic in ^Florida. He's attracted attention because he's suing the _P_G_A for the right to use a cart during tournaments. They don't want it.

 In Washington today, the Federal Aviation Administration released air traffic control tapes from the night the _T_W_A Flight eight hundred went down. There's nothing new on why the plane exploded, but you cannot miss the moment. _A_B_C's ^Lisa ^Stark has more. There was no hint of trouble in the last conversation between controllers and _T_W_A pilot ^Steven ^Snyder _T_W_A eight hundred climb maintain one five thousand. _T_W_A's eight hundred heavy climb and maintain one five thousand leavin three thousand. But a minute and a half later, a pilot from a nearby flight calls in. Ah, we just saw an explosion up ahead of us here about sixteen thousand feet or something like that. It just went down. The controller at ^Boston center tries to raise _T_W_A eight hundred. _T_W_A eight hundred, if you hear center, ident. There is no response. Later, the controller asks the Eastwind pilot for more details. Ah yes, sir. It It just blew up in the air, and then we saw two fireballs go down to the, to the water, and there was a big small, ah, smoke, from ah, coming up from that. At one point, when it became clear controllers could not contact the plane, someone said a prayer. _T_W_A eight hundred, center I think that was him. I think so. God bless him. ^Lisa ^Stark _A_B_C news ^Washington

 For his part, ^Fidel ^Castro is the ultimate political survivor. People have predicted his demise so many times, and the _U_S has tried to hasten it on several occasions. Time and again, he endures. He has outlasted and sometimes outsmarted eight American presidents. ^Fidel ^Castro invited ^John ^Paul to come for a reason. This is clearly an opportunity for Cuba to look good internationally. The entire world will see images of the Pope in Cuba. They'll see images of the Pope with ^Fidel ^Castro. It will give the rest of the world the view that Cuba is like any other nation, something the _U_S has, of course, tried to persuade the world that it is not. For nearly forty years, the United States has said categorically it would not tolerate totalitarian rule in its own backyard. It is the _U_S economic and political embargo which has kept Cuba in a box. The main positive for ^Castro to invite the Pope is international, to be able to say to the rest of the world, this government is not as closed, as intolerant, uh as totalitarian as some make it out to be. One of the scenarios widely advanced before the visit is that through the Pope, Cuba, still led by ^Castro, can begin a more productive relationship with the world. That will, in turn, bring pressure on ^Washington to change. Those observers looking for a battle between uncompromising representatives and very different ideologies will, in all likelihood, be disappointed. ^Castro has said that you can be a Communist and still be a Christian. He says he and the Pope both want to end the exploitation of man by man. The question is who will Cubans believe? The main negative is the risk that the Pope's visit will persuade a great many more Cubans to break loose of the Cuban government. If so, then the Pope's visit would really open up a new chapter in the government's relations with its own society. For the Cuban government, that is the risk. At the end of the broadcast this evening, one more trip around ^Havana to see what it's been like since the last time. And in just a moment ^Diane ^Sawyer will have some other news.
---------------------------
 The State Department issued its annual report on human rights today. The department says that ^China is still among the worst offenders. The government still stifles almost all dissent. In ^Russia, the department estimates that ten to twenty thousand people die every year because of deplorable prison conditions. In ^Algeria, the _U_S believes that government security forces may be involved in murdering civilians every month. Some of the other countries that make the list are ^Turkey, ^Iran, ^Cuba, ^Burma, ^Sudan and ^Afghanistan.
---------------------------
 The United States has finally succeeded in getting Japan to open its skies. An agreement announced today will dramatically increase the number of flights between American and Japanese cities.
---------------------------
 Finally tonight ^Brentwood, ^California. It is, as ^Yogi ^Berra would say, deja vu all over again. First ^Brentwood was overrun by the media during the Simpson case and now it's the scene of the ^Lewinsky watch. And a scene it is, and a pretty ugly one at that. And _A_B_C's ^Mike ^von ^Fremd is right in the middle of it. Did ^Betty coach the President? Welcome to what is supposed to be laid back Los Angeles. Chill, chill. Let's not get anybody hurt. ^Monica ^Lewinsky came here to get away from the chaos in the nation's capitol. But this is what happened when she tried to go out for a quiet dinner with her father. Hey, don't touch her. Hey pal, get your arms off her. Thursday night's incident was the final straw for an already angry community. What I thought when I saw that I said here we go with Princess ^Di again. I thought ^Diana would send a message. You don't kill people to get photographs. ^Lewinsky's minivan was rear ended by an associated press photographer's car last night. The Highway Patrol is investigating. Officials are being asked by residents to stop all this, but have no legal authority to do so. Under the first amendment, there's ah a clear guideline that when you're standing on public property, you have the right to do that. The current round of media madness is happening just blocks away from the spectacle that took place during the _O _J ^Simpson case and the year long stakeout at his house. We had eleven helicopters over our house one day. Eleven. Can you imagine the noise that made? I went down and had a root canal because I couldn't stand the noise here. For ^June Hall ^Davis the situation has gone from bad to worse. She lives directly across the street from ^Monica ^Lewinsky's father's house. ^Monica. Over here. This is now the new home of the paparazzi, and there seems little the ^Lewinskys or their neighbors can do to stop it. Let's see you, Monica. Monica ^Mike ^Von ^Fremd, _A_B_C News, ^Brentwood, ^California.

 You may recall on Tuesday this week the Senate finally got around to confirming the new surgeon general. It's been three years since the country had one, and more than five months since Doctor ^David ^Satcher was nominated. When President ^Clinton and Vice President ^Gore welcomed Doctor ^Satcher to the White House today, they were a little unfocused. The Vice President Wrote letters of support for Doctor ^Hatcher and No, it's ^Satcher with an _S. Let's try the President. Made it possible for us to swear in ^David ^Thatcher as the next surgeon general Oh, well. I, ^David ^Satcher do solemnly Welcome to ^Washington, Doctor ^Satcher.
---------------------------
 Finally from us this evening, gold for the women. There has never been a women's hockey before gold medal before. At first, the American women were not expected to do very well. And then they got rolling. Here's _A_B_C's ^Jon ^Frankel. In ^Nagano, it was a great day to be an American woman. Yes we're making history right now. scores The _U_S women opened the scoring against heavily favored Canada and never looked back. A centering pass and a goal. In the third period, two nothing. whoa and the empty net Goal. And when it was over, there was a moment at center ice which reminded so many of another Olympics, Lake Placid in nineteen eighty and another team _U_S_A. You know, it's it's it is, it's bizarre because you watched it so many times as a kid. and um you know, that's th the way we feel right now. And that's the way they were feeling in America today, in places such as ^Providence, ^Rhode ^Island, where they watched it all this morning and tried to imagine where women's hockey goes next. It's one of those things, that's like Mom, I want to do that, and I want to be there. In nineteen ninety, five thousand women were registered with _U_S hockey. Today, almost twenty four thousand are playing the game. And a gold medal can only make this sport grow. Winning the gold at ^Nagano gives all the little girls out there who idolize ^Cammi ^Granato or Carrie ^Bye it gives them a new goal to shoot for. The Olympics were once the end of the road for women in sports. There were no professional leagues for them to move on to. But women in hockey note the Olympics helped women basketball players get a league of their own, and they want one, too. Six of these gold medalists hope to play pro hockey in a new women's league next fall. Whatever its fate, if there was ever a day to contemplate professional women's hockey, today was the day. ^Jon ^Frankel, _A_B_C News.
---------------------------
 Just before we leave you, a brief review of the day's two major stories. President ^Clinton has given his cautious blessing to the deal that _U_N Secretary General Kofi Annan has made with ^Saddam ^Hussein. Mr. Clinton warns there are going to be serious consequences if Iraq does not follow through and keep the agreement.
---------------------------
 Another remnant of the Gulf War. A new study today suggests that as many as four hundred thousand American troops may have been exposed to particles of something called depleted uranium during the Gulf War. It is a nonradioactive metal used to make shells and bombs, and exposure to large amounts of it can cause kidney problems. The government has concluded that there is no link between depleted uranium and Gulf War syndrome.
---------------------------
 Finally today, we learned that the space agency has finally taken a giant leap forward. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel ^Eileen ^Collins will be named commander of the Space Shuttle Columbia for a mission in December. Colonel ^Collins has been the copilot before, but this time she's the boss. Here's _A_B_C's ^Ned ^Potter. Even two hundred miles up in space, there has been a glass ceiling. It wasn't until twenty years after the first astronauts were chosen that NASA finally included six women, and they were all scientists, not pilots. No woman has actually been in charge of a mission until now. Just the fact that we're doing the job that we're doing makes us role models. That was ^Eileen ^Collins, after she flew as the first ever copilot. Being commander is different. It means supervising the rest of the crew in training and leading them in flight. It is, in short, the kind of management job many American women say they've had to fight for. In space, some say female pilots were held up until now by the lack of piloting opportunities for them in the military. Once Colonel Collins was picked as a NASA astronaut, she followed a normal progression within NASA. Nobody hurried her up. No one held her back. Many _N_A_S_A watchers say female astronauts have become part of the agency's routine. But they still have catching up to do two hundred and thirty four Americans have flown in space, only twenty six of them women. ^Ned ^Potter, _A_B_C News.
---------------------------
 In Indonesia, the most defiant protest yet against the dictatorship of President ^Suharto, who is himself clearly defying international pressure to make economic reforms which he promised. This is getting more serious by the day. Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world. And political and economic upheaval in this Asian nation stretches all the way to main street _U_S_A. Tonight, in the city of ^Jogjakarta, _A_B_C's ^Mark ^Litke. At the oldest, most respected university in Indonesia, thousands of students poured out of their classrooms, demanding an end to the regime of President ^Suharto. They accused ^Suharto and his family of corruption and mismanagement of the country, blaming thirtytwo years of ^Suharto rule for all the nation's current woes. For the seventy percent plunge in the currency, for the forty percent and rising inflation rate, for the millions of new unemployed and for bankrupting their future. President ^Suharto tolerates very little dissent. There's now a total ban on street demonstrations here, and thousands of heavily armed troops have been deployed to enforce that ban. The few who've tried to protest recently have been dealt with harshly. But the troops have not moved to stop campus protests so far. ^Suharto knows that could ignite a firestorm in the current climate. It was, after all, angry students who backed Suharto's rise to power three decades ago. ^Mark ^Litke, _A_B_C News, ^Jogjakarta.
---------------------------
 Other news today, the Food and Drug Administration has approved a new test for prostate cancer. The test, called free _P_S_A detects up to ninetyfive percent of all prostate cancers and could reduce by a hundred and sixty thousand the number of people who need exploratory surgery.
---------------------------
 In the Middle East, Israeli prime minister ^Benjamin ^Netanyahu has apologized for the killings of three Palestinians at an Israeli checkpoint last night. The killings prompted stone throwing demonstrations today, which Israeli troops met with rubber bullets. On the West bank, the three workers were buried after a funeral procession that attracted thousands of mourners.
---------------------------
 One of the world's greatest treasures and one of its oldest cultures are threatened tonight by massive forest fires. It is happening in northern Brazil in the Amazon rain forest. And it is a devastating natural disaster, brought on by nature and by man. Here's _A_B_C's ^Deborah ^Amos. Fires are burning out of control over an area bigger than the state of Delaware, now scorching large parts of the rain forests for the first time in thousands of years. And now the ^Yanomami Indians, who have lived in those forests for thousands of years, are at risk. The flames are close, the fish and wild life they live on are dying, and many fear so is an ancient way of life. Firefighters battle the blaze with the most basic tools. But with fires advancing at six miles a day, there's no way they can stop it. This fire chief says there's no more hope for this part of the forest. ^El ^Nino is partly to blame. Drought made the forest floor a tinder box this year, but local loggers and farmers also played a role. Traditional slash and burn agriculture got out of control. Seasonal rains could douse all these flames, but there's been no rain for six months and none is in sight. Tonight, the Yanomami elders are praying for rain. ^Deborah ^Amos, _A_B_C News.
---------------------------
 Now, for a story about repentance and revival. In nineteen ninetyfive, Christian singer ^Sandi ^Patty admitted to a scandalous affair and begged for forgiveness. It's been a rocky road, but as _A_B_C's ^Mike ^von ^Fremd reports, she is now finally winning back her old fans. Last night in a Baptist church thirty minutes from the White House, ^Sandi ^Patty's fans came to listen and offer comfort. She's human. I mean, just because she made some mistakes or some bad decisions doesn't mean she's any less of a Christian. Entertainers in the world of Christian music are expected to hold the highest moral ground. But the lifestyle ^Patty revealed to Primetime Live in this interview last year sounded more like the Country and Western song your cheating heart. I don't want to pretend anymore. I want to, I want to set things right. I don't know if there's even a way to make some horrendous wrongs right. Patty had an affair with her backup singer, left her husband and stunned her fans. A lot of people feel a certain sense of betrayal. Someone who they felt was one thing suddenly appears to be another. They were, in effect, living a lie. And in Christian music, the integrity of the message depends greatly on the integrity of the messenger. Another Christian singer, Michael English, has a similar confession and he also has a concert here in Washington tonight. English had left his wife for a singer in a Christian group who miscarried his child. His comeback has been more difficult. When English admitted adultery in nineteen ninety four, he did not repent as publicly and his records were pulled from Christian music shelves. In the five hundred fifty million a year world of Christian music, failing to make a public confession can be a costly mistake. Both singers are now traveling the road to recovery in a city where dealing with adultery is very much on people's minds. ^Mike ^von ^Fremd, _A_B_C News, Washington.
---------------------------
 Good evening. We begin tonight with one of those events in the category of things we thought we might never see. We remembered today that after the Berlin Wall came down, after South Africa became a democracy and even the Arabs and Israelis had shaken hands, an end to what they call the troubles in Northern Ireland seemed remote at best. The troubles may not be completely over, but they did make history in Belfast today. At ^Stormont Castle today, Catholics, including representatives of the Irish Republican Army and their Protestant adversaries, have agreed to make peace after three decades of violence that took more than three thousand lives. The former _U_S Senator George ^Mitchell led the negotiations. It doesn't take courage to shoot a policeman in the back of the head or to murder an unarmed taxi driver. What takes courage is to compete in the arena of democracy. Northern Ireland has been part of Great Britain since nineteen twentyone. Under today's deal, it will be governed, at least in part, by an elected Northern Ireland Assembly in which Catholics and Protestants will share power, and a North South Council, meaning more cooperation between the North and the Republic of Ireland, the country to the south. A lot remains to be settled. The Catholic minority wants these to be strong institutions, to guarantee the rights they feel that they have been denied. The Protestants want the institutions to be weak. They believe that their interests are best served the more power that Great Britain retains. No one, of course, discounts the chance that extremists on both sides will use violence again. So the question is, will the agreement stick? Will this really be remembered as the day that peace came to Northern Ireland? In Belfast tonight, _A_B_C's Jim ^Wooten. If Belfast's ordinary folks seemed slightly less than jubilant today, certainly less excited than their newspapers. Whether it comes through or not is a is a debatable point. Do I feel hopeful? No. I I can't quite honestly say that I do. Maybe they've learned from their yesterdays not to expect too much from their tomorrows. There were Good Friday prayers for peace, of course, from Protestants and Catholics too. Such good people of such deep faith, it's hard to believe their past is so savage. It's hard to forget, much less to forgive. Seven thousand people have seen a member of their immediate family killed. I mean, we've had too much. They hadn't known life at all. So at the White Fork Pub today, the cheers were mainly for soccer, not the promise of peace because There's always going to be a small minority of people who will always want to keep the pot boiling. Even though the mainstream Protestant and Catholic groups are parties to this agreement, a handful of killers could still wreck it. That's what happened in nineteen seventyfour when a similar power sharing arrangement, without Sinn Fein and the _I_R_A, was attacked by Protestant hardliners. God help those ladies and gentlemen who get in our way. And replaced with years of violence today's agreement is meant to stop. The people of Northern Ireland will have to approve it, of course, in a referendum. And with a Protestant majority, that is no sure thing, which may help to explain the absence of joy on the streets of this city today. They have, after all, been here before. I just pray to God that we can all live together. Maybe, maybe they will. Jim ^Wooten, _A_B_C News, Belfast. The negotiations lasted twentytwo months. In the last session, thirtytwo straight hours. The man in charge of it all, the newsmaker here, was an American, former Senator George ^Mitchell of Maine. You want me to sit? All right. Don't be deceived by his owlish appearance, say his friends. The man is very determined. George ^Mitchell left the Senate three years ago because he found it unsatisfying. There was talk about being baseball commissioner, but the British prime minister knew his reputation as a master of compromise. That and an Irish connection, ^Mitchell's father is Irish, his mother Lebanese, soon landed him in the toughest imaginable negotiations. These talks between Protestants and Catholics were often so contentious that one participant said he thought ^Mitchell might pack it in and go back to America. For his part, he says he has never met nicer people in the world. I have this absolute belief that everyone who has benefited has an obligation to do for others if that chance arises. But he can come home now, this sixtyfour year old man from Maine. His young wife and a brand new baby boy are waiting. The deal that Senator ^Mitchell has so successfully put together will be put to a vote in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic next month.

 This weekend's big NASCAR race is the ^Goodies five hundred in ^Martinsville, Virginia. Which means quite simply that ^Goodies headache powder is the sponsor. At ^Goodies, they're very much looking forward to all of the commercial exposure that they will probably get this weekend. In fact, when you think about it, have you ever seen a NASCAR anything that wasn't plastered with somebody's advertising? _A_B_C's Robert ^Krulwich tonight on selling at high speed. Great crowd on hand. Glad to have you with us here for today's ^Goodies five hundred. Once upon a time, stock cars were supposed to be just like the cars you would find in stock in any showroom. But, your car does not have a seven hundred horsepower engine in it, and your car does not have writing on it here, here, here, here, here, or even here. This is a billboard. This great big old race car is out there, and it's getting on television. Which is why every available surface is covered with, There's Miller. There's Mobil. There's Valvoline, Ford, Bosch, Cummins, Goodyear on _T_V. Which brings us to a guy named Bob in Michigan. He is paid to watch _T_V tapes of every NASCAR race and keep track of every second a sponsor's logo appears on television. So this sign here and this sign here and this sign here Yes as well as what's on the hood. Bob's calculations are published in something called the sponsors report, which tells each sponsor the total time its logo was seen on _T_V during a race and compares the total to the cost of a television commercial in the same race. For example, in this race, the report claims Valvoline got twenty eight minutes and seventeen seconds of exposure. That is worth over four hundred seventy five thousand dollars. And the fans? Well, they love the sponsors for supporting the sport. For example, watch this. I'm going to name a driver. What I'd like you to do is, in unison, tell me the product that they represent. The driver is ^Dale ^Earnhardt. What's his product? Goodwrench Jeff Gordon? Mark Martin? Not only can these fans connect all the drivers with their products, if they like the driver, they will buy the product. I use Tide because they sponsor. We oh, That is Rusty Wallace in the car number two. The Miller Genuine Draft Ford Thunderbird. But the true test for a driver is whether he has the stamina to survive the hat dance. The winning driver owes every one of his sponsors a picture of the team wearing each sponsor's hat. So, forty sponsors, forty hats. Everybody put your ^Goodies hat on! Even the hat man wants _T_V exposure. He has a hat. Would you like to wear it? No. I want you to I don't wear hats. All right, I'll wear it. All right. I will now wear Bill's hat on _T_V for nine and a half seconds. The ^Bill ^Brodrick hat, which will earn him how much in _T_V exposure? This much. Robert ^Krulwich, _A_B_C News.
---------------------------
 Bad weather continued to plague parts of the South today. In ^Waynesboro, Virginia, dense fog led to a sixtyfive car pileup on an interstate. Police say no one was seriously injured. And in Knoxville, Tennessee, heavy spring rains and flooding continued to threaten residents. Dozens of elderly residents had to be evacuated from a nursing home. Residents of Grand Forks, North Dakota, gathered today to remember last year's devastating floods. It was one year ago today that the dike along the Red River crumbled, forcing the evacuation of fifty thousand people.
---------------------------
 Here's a very different challenge. In ^San ^Rafael, California, today a jury has been forced to look at a very unusual problem. ^Horace ^Kelly has been sentenced to death for committing murder. After spending ten years on death row, his lawyers now claim he's insane. Therefore, can you kill him? Can you make him sane and then kill him? Here's _A_B_C's ^Terry ^Moran. ^Horace ^Kelly was tried, convicted and sentenced to death for the nineteen eightyfour murders of two women and a child. While on death row in ^San ^Quentin prison, he descended into madness. Prison psychiatrists diagnosed ^Kelly as schizophrenic and found him to be increasingly detached from reality. ^Kelly's lawyer claims he is too deranged to be executed. Mr. ^Kelly uh never speaks unless he is spoken to. uh Mr. ^Kelly uh has never evinced to me any understanding uh that he uh knows what is going on here today or or yesterday or what will be hap happening tomorrow. Prosecutors argue that while ^Kelly may be disturbed, he is fit enough to face execution. The ^Horace ^Kelly case marks the first time in nearly half a century that a California jury has been asked to determine if a condemned man is sane enough to be put to death. We don't execute the insane because of what it would uh say about us as a society. I um this would be a simply pointless brutality. But even if the jury determines that ^Horace ^Kelly is insane, it won't save his life. He would be sent to a mental hospital to be medicated until he is healthy enough to be killed. How healthy is that? Not very. To be incompetent for execution, one has to be so crazy that she or he doesn't even know what day it is or what's going on around her. Many doctors say it is unethical to cure a person simply so the state can then kill him. And that has left one death row inmate in Florida in a legal and medical limbo, untreated and unpunished for fourteen years. ^Terry ^Moran, _A_B_C News, New York.

 From targeting the consumer to targeting the military. In Washington, the Pentagon has acknowledged today that another group of computer hackers has managed to break into an important military computer system. The Pentagon says it has been one of the most serious breakins ever. ABC's John ^McWethy is at the Pentagon with us this evening. John, there were some reports today that suggest national security may have seriously been compromised. What do you know? Peter, the Pentagon says that is not so. This was not a classified breakin. It was into an unclassified part of the computer system. uh They say it is a management or bookkeeping software program that was pulled down by the computer hackers this time. You might compare it to a blank tax return form. Until you fill in the numbers and the name, uh it is not that sensitive of material. Still, they are very concerned about John, we've had several reports about this over the last few months. How serious are they, and is there a pattern here? uh There is a pattern of persistence. Many, many hackers are trying to get into all of the different Pentagon systems. The Defense Department says as yet, never has the really classified part of the Defense Department system been broken into. That's where they spend their money, and that is where they put up the firewall. So far, they've been successful. Okay, thanks, John ^McWethy at the Pentagon this evening.

 In Scotland today, nuclear material which had been urgently transported out of the former Soviet republic of Georgia is on its way to be reprocessed. As we reported on Tuesday, the Georgians had asked the _U_S and Britain to get it out of the country so it could not be stolen.
---------------------------
 With now four fatal school shootings in the past six months, the question again around the country is why. Here's _A_B_C's ^Farai ^Chideya. The images have become eerily familiar. Blood on the ground, police tape, teens shocked and sobbing. Pearl, Mississippi. Paducah, Kentucky. Jonesboro, Arkansas. And now ^Edinboro, Pennsylvania. Well, I think he did this for attention because there's a lot of anger in him, just to make a statement. Experts see similarities in the cases. You find that there were clues, often clues going on for years, not just months that this child was in trouble, that there were psychological problems, there were uh emotional problems and that attention should have been paid long ago. Although the overall teen homicide rate has dropped thirtyone percent since nineteen ninetythree, these school related killings have a significance that far outweighs their number. Fatal homicides, fatal shootings are very rare in school. But they're cause for concern because they're indicative of the kinds of violence that does occur and the consequences are so tragic. In reaction to the Jonesboro shooting, the White House met just yesterday with experts on teen violence. Although statistics tell us this kind of incident is rare, each new school shooting impacts harder than the last. ^Farai ^Chideya, _A_B_C News, New York.

 In Pennsylvania today, and it's become a reasonably familiar scene, hugs and tears as students returned to class after a fourteen year old boy shot and killed a teacher at a graduation dance on Friday night. And in North Carolina, where a four year old boy accidentally shot and killed a six year old playmate over the weekend, the shooter's grandmother was charged today with failing to store the weapon safely. In both cases, the guns belonged to adults. And there is growing pressure to hold adults responsible when kids with guns cause harm. Here's _A_B_C's legal correspondent ^Terry ^Moran. ^Paducah, Jonesboro, ^Edinboro, whether it's intentional or accidental, whether the victims are other children or adults, when American kids pick up guns, the results are often horrifying. a I didn't know my da my dad's gun was loaded, and And I, and I shot her. I didn't mean to. She's dead. She's dead? Yes. Please get my mom and dad. Oh, my God. One increasingly popular response, blame the adults. Over the past decade, fifteen states have passed laws which hold gun owners criminally responsible when a child uses the adult's gun and injures someone. A recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that in twelve states which hold adults responsible for wayward guns, unintentional shooting deaths among children under fifteen were down twentythree percent. Doctor Frederick ^Rivara is coauthor of the study. This law doesn't say anything about whether or not people should ow own guns in their home. It really tries to avoid that whole very emotional political topic. But instead, says if you have a gun in the home, we want you to store it safely. The _N_R_A opposes most gun access laws, arguing that educating children, not punishing grieving parents is the answer. If you're talking about putting parents on notice if they do something incredibly stupid, that they can be held criminal responsible for negligence, they they already can be held criminally negligent. Whether it is tougher laws or better gun education, everyone agrees more needs to be done. For American children are still twelve times more likely to die by firearms than children in the other twentyfive industrialized nations combined. ^Terry ^Moran, _A_B_C News, New York.

 Ever since the country learned as much as it did about President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, the crucial questions were, what did they do together, if anything, and what did he ask her to say about their relationship, if anything? And has the President told the country the truth or broken the law? From the beginning, Miss Lewinsky's attorney has insisted she would certainly not talk to a grand jury unless she were given immunity from prosecution. _A_B_C News has now learned that her lawyer has lost an important battle. We go to Washington and _A_B_C's Jackie Judd. For weeks, the case involving Monica Lewinsky and President Clinton has been in virtual limbo while the judge considered what the ground rules would be for Lewinsky's testimony. Her lawyer, William Ginsburg, had gone to federal court arguing that Kenneth Starr had reneged on a deal to shield Lewinsky completely from prosecution in exchange for her cooperation. Sources say Lewinsky was prepared to admit that she did have a sexual relationship with the President, but not that he encouraged her to lie about it under oath. Now, lawyers familiar with the investigation have told _A_B_C News that Judge Norma Johnson has ruled against Ginsburg. There was no deal. Ginsburg and prosecutors declined comment. Starr now has several options. He could force Lewinsky to appear before the grand jury with limited immunity. That would still give him the ability to prosecute her based on evidence provided by others. Or Starr could bypass the grand jury altogether and indict her as a means of presenting evidence involving the President. Lewinsky has an option, as well. If she is brought before the grand jury, she could refuse to testify, although that could land her in jail for contempt. It's high stakes for the central character in this scandal. And the next move is up to Starr. Peter? Jackie, if I understand it correctly, a grand jury in Arkansas today heard the testimony that Mrs. Clinton gave on videotape on Saturday. Current questions or old questions? Old questions. No Lewinskyrelated questions. Questions relating to the mid eighties when she was a lawyer, when Mr. Clinton was the governor of Arkansas. Her lawyer said today Mrs. Clinton refused to answer two questions about conversations she'd had with her husband, the President, citing spousal privilege. That is, a husband and wife cannot be compelled to testify against each other. we don't we don't know the subject of those, right? That's right. Okay, many thanks. Jackie Judd in Washington.
---------------------------
 And late today, when the independent counsel's grand jury indicted the President's close friend ^Webb ^Hubbell again, it was clearly seen in Washington as pressure on the President's inner circle. Mr. ^Hubbell has been indicted on charges of tax evasion and conspiracy. But the independent counsel has a great many other questions. In Washington, _A_B_C's Jackie Judd. The indictment alleges ^Webb ^Hubbell schemed to avoid paying taxes since nineteen eightynine, that in the mid nineties alone, he earned over a million dollars, yet paid only a fraction of what was owed to the _I_R_S. The ^Hubbells owed taxes, interest and penalties to the _I_R_S, the state of Arkansas and the District of Columbia in excess of eight hundred and ninetyfour thousand dollars. Independent counsel Ken Starr has been investigating whether the income ^Hubbell earned was hush money arranged by friends of the White House, such as Vernon ^Jordan and Mickey ^Kantor, at a time when ^Hubbell was being pressured to cooperate with Starr and the Whitewater probe. Prosecutors ultimately concluded ^Hubbell did not tell them all he knew. The financial help, about seven hundred thousand dollars in all, came four years ago after ^Hubbell left the Justice Department in disgrace and before he reported to jail for cheating his Little Rock law firm. To increase the pressure on ^Hubbell to cooperate now, the independent counsel also indicted his wife, his tax attorney and his accountant. But ^Hubbell said late today that nothing will make him betray his friends. The office of independent counsel can indict my dog. They can indict my cat. But I'm not going to lie about the President. I'm not going to lie about the First Lady. Prosecutors do clearly hope that ^Hubbell will feel enough pressure to now reveal why he got all of that financial help, whether it was about blocking Ken Starr's investigation and obstruction of justice. Peter? Thanks, ^Jackie. As you know, the President and Mrs. Clinton issued a statement today in which they said they were saddened by what's happening to the Hubbells and to the others indicted.

 A very strange story about a murder confession appeared today on the front page of The New York Times. It is certainly a prominent place for a news story to be displayed. But the confession in question, by a man to murdering his five year old daughter, appeared even before that on the Internet. We are going to take A Closer Look tonight because the man actually confessed to murder while he was online talking to and, in this case, sharing some of his most personal secrets with people who only knew him through his keyboard. First, from _A_B_C's ^Aaron Brown, the story of how the murder was revealed. For three years, the seventeen hundred residents of ^Bowman, North Dakota, didn't even suspect a murder had been committed in their town. Five year old Amanda ^Froistad's death in a fire at her father's home was ruled an accident. And it would have stayed that way had her father, Larry, not allegedly confessed to setting the fire. His purported confession was emailed over the Internet to fellow members of a problem drinkers support group. ^Froistad wrote, I let her watch the videos she loved all evening. And when she was asleep, I got wickedly drunk, set our house on fire, went to bed, listened to her scream twice. Hearing her wheeze in the smoke I could barely stand, looking at her bedroom door burning. These are things I can't forget. Two hundred members of the group received the message, including ^Elisa ^DeCarlo in Manhattan. And I screamed. That was my first reaction. But judging from their emails, most others in the group didn't know what to think or what to do. Wrote group leader Frederick ^Rogers , a Rutgers university psychologist, We have two responsibilities here, to ourselves as members of this community and to the larger community beyond. ^Rogers did not call police and questions whether others should have. I had no way of knowing for sure whether w uh what he was saying was true. ^Rogers and others decided therapy would be best. Wrote group member ^Kay, I don't think this group is enough. What a very painful thing in many, many ways. And others were simply frustrated at the turn their support group had taken. Wrote one member, Can we please talk about drinking? I need your help here. Only a handful of people who read ^Froistad's chilling words called police. Jim ^Shirk in ^Bremerton, ^Washington, was one of them. It surprises me that so many saw it differently, and so few uh felt the way I did. That that surprises me and really saddens me. Still, the case strongly suggests that many people have come to believe their most personal email communications are both private and confidential. And that's something the law doesn't allow and the open nature of the Internet cannot possibly provide. ^Aaron Brown, _A_B_C News, New York. We were somewhat surprised today that so many members of Larry ^Froistad's support group were so openly reluctantly to think of him as a criminal or to turn him in. And it made us wonder, yet again, whether cyberspace is encouraging a whole new culture to develop. There are certainly the makings of a new language. The people who take part in these group discussions are said to post what they're thinking. And so, they're posters. Those who only listen are lurkers. Over time, the group may become a virtual family. All families argue, of course. And if you raise your voice in cyberspace argument, you type in capital letters. That is shouting on the Internet. When you insult another person, you are said to have flamed them. You can apologize with an emoticon, an emotional expression made by combining symbols on the keyboard. It actually looks more familiar to many of us when you actually put it this way. But is there a different mindset on the Internet? We have been talking to Dr. ^Kimberly ^Young, who specializes in neuropsychology, including something called Internet addiction disorder. Dr. ^Young, is the Internet and these groups really a special place with a different culture, or are they just like the rest of us? Well, on one hand, the Internet does reflect, I think, a lot of what society represents. On the other hand, it it does have a culture all of its own, its own separate language. What's interesting is that what might take you and I months or years to develop an intimate relationship may only take days or weeks online. Um the fact that you're anonymously communicating with other people uh allows you sort of the freedom of expression that goes deeper than sort of facetoface communication. So subjectively, people feel quite intimate online in just a matter of days. But confessing to murder? Well, many times people find this sort of safe behind the safety behind the computer screen. They find that um in general it seems that they can say things, and often times I find people forget that they're talking to other real people. It's sort of like journaling in a notepad, but an electronic one where other people are are reading what you're writing. So sometimes that compels us to say things we normally wouldn't say or to be more uninhibited online. Well, Dr. ^Young, in real life, you're very helpful. Well, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Larry ^Froistad, the man who got us thinking about all this today, will be arraigned tomorrow in North Dakota on charges of murder.

 Extinguish the blaze except for one spot which may be emitting hazardous fumes. Toxic smoke had been pouring from a huge fire at a fertilizer warehouse on the Ohio river. More than twenty five hundred people have been evacuated, and four have been hospitalized. Authorities have just used water on the fire for the first time and they say there was a risk the impact of the water on four hundred tons of burning ammonium nitrate, might have caused an explosion. We are now joined live by ^Rich ^Jaffe of _C_N_N affiliate _W_K_R_C and ^Rich. how far away from the fire are you? ^Judy we're standing about a mile from the fire. the ^Cargil fertilizer plant is just down the road here. Throughout the day from our vantage point we've been able to see a large y yellow column of smoke towering above the houses here. The fire began about three _A_M this morning and while the scene here is reasonable calm right now, this morning the scene here was quite a different one. Before dawn the sky around ^Maysville was filled with thick black acrid smoke. The fumes and threat of explosion forcing the evacuation of nearly two thousand people My husband went down on the corner to try and get some neighbors up and he like to beat had to beat the doors down to get them you know get them up. And then some of the older people didn't really want to leave their homes. So yeah it it was scary I ain't never had to be evacuated before so I was a nervous wreck. Inside the blazing ^Cargil plant herbicides, pesticides and four hundred and twenty tons of ammonium nitrate, the same fertilizer used to blow up the federal building in Oklahoma city. Residents of ^Maysville are not the only ones at risk from this fire you can see the smoke blowing the plume across the river and into Ohio. We're on a ridge in ^Brown county overlooking the fire and from up here, you can hear the thousands of small explosions down there making it sound more like a battle zone. early on the decision was made to let the fire burn itself out. w we felt like at the at the point that we were at that we could not put out the fire with the resources we had. And the the building had already more or less been destroyed. uh we had be been no benefit of extinguishing the fire and especially with the hazard of explosion, we are talking about a large explosion and the possibility of uh injuring or or killing several firefighters. Uh the gains weren't worth the risks. Investigators from the ^Kentucky state fire marshal's office say it will be days if not weeks before they can determine the cause of this blaze. Right now the concern is shifting to that smoke plume and possible environmental impact, ^Judy. ^Rich any idea when residents can begin returning home? They just finished an assessment of the scene and y as you mentioned a few moments ago. they put water on it for the first time. That seems to have been doing the job. there is one hot spot left, once they get that extinguished, they hope that residents will begin returning to their homes in a couple of hours. That's good news for the residents thanks. ^Rich ^Jaffe of _C_N_N affiliate _W_K_R_C we appreciate the live report.

Tuesday morning's grammy nominations, where she was a guest announcer, may mark her coming out party. She got seven nominations, and that was a surprise. definitely.

 In urban schools, teachers have low expectations of their students and the kids seldom exceed them. That's according to a report complied by education week newspaper. It shows students in urban schools scored lower in standardized tests than students in other areas. Only nineteen percent of the teachers surveyed said their students had skills required to do well in college. And forty percent said a high school diploma is no guarantee that a student has learned the basics.

 New information released today may support the argument for cutting greenhouse gases to combat global warming. Federal climate researchers say nineteen ninetyseven was the warmest year of the century. And for the first time, leaders of NOAH the national oceanic and atmospheric administration officially say human activity is at least partly to blame. Overall, researchers say oceans warmed up more than land. The ocean temperatures, if we separate ocean from land, the ocean temperatures in nineteen ninetyseven were the warmest on record, about three quarters of a degree warmer than the mean. The mean being calculated from nineteen sixtyone to ninety, and that mean temperature um is of the order of sixty or so degrees Fahrenheit, roughly speaking. Now, if we look at land temperatures, nineteen ninetyseven was in the top five. worry about ah researchers also say the El Nino weather pattern contributed to last year's warning. ah warming, sorry.

 Jazz teachers and musicians from around the world are in New York for the twentyfifth annual convention of the international association of jazz educators. Cynthia ^Tornquist checks out the site and the sounds. Even in ^Kazakhstan, it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing. Musicians from ^Kazakhstan were among some seven thousand jazz players, educators and students from thirtyfive countries who gathered in New York for a conference of the international association of jazz educators. While it is probably the greatest jazz hang in the world, it's also a place to come and learn and and uh make those connections that will help you grow as a player, as a teacher, and as a student. While jazz has found an enthusiastic audience in France, Japan and elsewhere, it accounts for only three percent of the overall music market in the United States. Musicians believe its growth in America was stunted in the nineteen twenties and thirties because regular folks labeled it whore house music. For many years, the image of jazz was uh uh the image of people who smoked and drank and who worked in nightclubs and who lived a very fast life. Now today, most of us work in colleges. The venues for the music have changed, so people expect expect to see a guy dressed like me instead of a guy with a cigarette and a hat. Billy Taylor learned by listening to Dizzy Gillespie, Count ^Basie and Duke Ellington. Today, students have the advantage of a formal jazz education. Just like any other craft, you hone it little steps at a time. and then it becomes uh ingrained so much in you that you can then emote by feeling. Wynton ^Marsalis, who teaches at Lincoln Center, tells students not to let a few bad notes hold them back. Now I know you all can relate to that sound. Anyone who's ever been in a elementary school band knows what that is. An art form, i it takes you into very the central heart of who you are so uh tha that's key, is that what teaches you who you are. Most academic disciplines teach you to be the same way. But if you're a jazz player, you don't want to sound like Miles Davis, you want to sound different from him. But you want to sound better. The conference allowed jazz educators to exchange ideas. Exhibitors displayed new technology, and students rubbed elbows with professionals. Seeing how they play and are uh have a stage presence, you learn something from that. There's some very talented young people out here, and I'm happy to see them fighting through the trouble to get to this music. Though jazz record sales have not increased significantly, it's clear that interest in jazz is growing nationally and internationally. Regardless of uh uh political systems and historical backgrounds of the country and so on, and u jazz accumulate more and more recognition anyway b. As jazz becomes more fashionable, if you will, we hear jazz on commercials now, and and it seems to be hip and if we um I think are good at what we do we take advantage of that and and and utilize that to help bring jazz into the living room in in uh middle America and uh that is starting to make a difference.

 The Tiffany network as Chuck said, has scored a major victory. _C_B_S back in the game of broadcasting pro football after four years on the sidelines. The network will pay four billion dollars for an eight year deal to televise American football conference games which previously aired on _N_B_C. e It certainly gets them back as far a major player e in sports is concerned, gets them back in stronger relationships with their affiliates and advertisers, um gets back a lot of what they lost four years ago from an image standpoint. and certainly, as they're kind of rallying their forces to rebuild that network into number one, it's it's a good, bold, aggressive move. Investors agree _C_B_S scored a touchdown. Stock up seven eighths of a point. The NewsCorp shares were down five eighths because ^Fox gets to keep _N_F_C games. But shares of Disney, parent company of _A_B_C up five eighths, and General Electric, which owns _N_B_C, gained almost a quarter. They are battling for the broadcast rights to Monday night football.

 A new report reveals more problems at the Internal Revenue Service. A broad review of the agency found it used improper tactics in evaluating _I_R_S employees at many _I_R_S offices across the country. They were in fact graded on how aggressively they collected money from some taxpayers. Treasury Secretary ^Robert ^Rubin said relying on such measures puts taxpayers rights in jeopardy across the country and doesn't focus on improving the quality of services. This follows a senate hearing in September, where the _I_R_S was accused of being abusive and using its powers in an arbitrary manner.

 Five weeks after its opening, Titanic is still the top box office draw. Studio executives attribute part of the film's success to repeat business and from one group of moviegoers in particular. ^Cynthia ^Tornquist has details. god almighty Many thought a film version of the Titanic would go down along with its famous namesake. Little did Hollywood realize box office receipts would be kept afloat in part by America's teenage girls. It's a great movie. It's sentimental. The story is great. It's like you feel you're there, that you're experiencing the emotion. I was just about to see it today, but the tickets are all sold Since its December release, the film has earned close to two hundred forty million dollars in North America. only two films have reached similar sums more quickly, Independence Day and Jurassic Park. Studio executives say that part of the film's success comes from repeat business, especially from teenage girls. A survey found that more than seven percent of female teens have seen the film more than once. I think it's two things. One, it's ^Leonardo DiCaprio. He's really cute if you're about sixteen years old, and they all saw him in ^Romeo and ^Juliet and got a big crush and they're going to go back and back and back to see him. But two, you've got a big sweeping love story, and boy, when you're a teenage girl there's nothing better. I saw that in a nickelodeon once and I always wanted to do it. He should win, like, triple awards for it. Great. Four stars. It's wonderful. It's one of the best love stories, and it is done in such a classic way and it is shot so beautifully that it's just moving. I cried like nine times. I was so psyched. The focus of these two characters is is what the audience is into for the first two hours of the movie. And you almost don't want to don't want the the ship to the ship to sink after a while, you wanted to see what develops between these two people. Jack This is where we first met. Well, i read the treatment and was incredibly moved by it, and thought, you know, this is just too good to miss. It's wonderful for teenagers to see young stars, you know, who are practically in their age group, playing these grand, huge movie roles. Cynthia ^Tornquist, _C_N_N entertainment news, New York.

 The allegations against President Clinton, specifically that he obstructed justice, are potentially the greatest threat to a sitting president since Watergate. One of the central figures in that scandal was the former White House counsel John ^Dean. John ^Dean joins us live from Los Angeles to offer his unique perspective on the current crisis. Thanks very much for joining us. What's your take on all of this? Well, it's a ah fascinating time. It's ah not quite deja vu, though, because I think we're talking about a whole different range of uh problems that confronted uh Richard Nixon than what is now facing Bill Clinton. What is the White House counsel's r role? Who does he work for? The office or the occupant? Well I i it was very it may have evolved it may have changed. uh When I was there, I was working for the president in both personal matters, as well as in matters for the presidency itself. I think today that there's much less on the personal side than there was when I was there. And I think Chuck ^Ruff is doing nothing but the presidential aspect of it. Is he allowed to get into the Paula Jones case? Well I I think that from what I gather from some recent news reports, uh obviously he's somehow involved in it, but I think, recent reports, he's uh he's really not the key man. With Mr. ^Kantor coming back and and the private counsel handling it, I think we're seeing much more being handled by his private lawyers than his White House counsel. Alright what do what do polls how do polls impact? The they're are are they everything or are they just a part of the equation? Well they're they're a big part. Uh there's no question that presidents uh follow the polls. Most public uh e elected officials do and uh I don't think that he makes his decisions on the basis of a of a poll as to what he's going to say. But the timing of it certainly may may be affected by the poll. All right, John ^Dean, the man who declared there was a cancer on the presidency so many years ago. Thank you very much for joining us. I appreciate it. Thank you.

 A new movie follows the quirky life of private detective ^Darryl Zero. Paul ^Vercammen explains Zero is one character who really lives up to his name. I work for a private detective named ^Darryl Zero. In zero effect actor Bill Pullman plays the self proclaimed world's greatest criminal investigator. He's a smooth operator while on the job, but come quitting time he's a Complete freak. Nuts. Tactless. Terrible. Rude. This mysterious man runs a successful business by maintaining a life devoid of personal connections or passions. Pullman's quirky character uses sharply honed powers he calls the two obs. By observation, you know, careful observation and being objective, you know, you can um detect things that maybe go undetected to the average eye. In reality, Pullman says he can be annoyingly obstinate about following the two obs. I can get bogged down with the obs. You know, I think um oh it's that thing of like, can you see the forest through the trees? Are the details going to keep you from seeing the big picture? And ah some days I get so lost in the details you know I, I can't even make it down to get my newspaper. Ben Stiller plays a frontman for Zero who hides the detective's neuroses from high paying clients. These two guys who obviously work so closely had such a strange kind of codependent, almost like a, relationship relationship. That was kind of the way we looked at it. You know these were two guys who were ah breaking up really. Stiller, a native New Yorker, enjoyed the change of pace while shooting the film on location in Portland, Oregon. I had my motorcycle up there so I s took some trips up you know around in the in the forest there. Yes, I have a motorcycle. Even though I'm from New York and I'm Jewish, okay?

 Medical researchers are warning pregnant women to stop or cut back on their consumption of caffeine. They have found the drug could increase the chances of sudden infant death syndrome. ^Rhonda ^Rowland reports. Most doctors advise pregnant women to avoid coffee, tea and other caffeinated beverages. Studies have linked them to miscarriage and low birth weight. Now a new study, this one published in the Archives of Disease in Childhood shows caffeine consumption during pregnancy may lead to SIDS. There's evidence, not great, but evidence that babies who go on to die of SIDS are not normal even from their very first day of life, which means it's happening sometime prior to tha birth. The study shows heavy caffeine consumption, that is, drinking four or more cups of coffee a day throughout pregnancy, almost doubled the chance of SIDS. Researchers suggest the reason may be that high levels of caffeine may alter the fetus' respiratory system. Caffeine is a drug, you know, and it has a generalized effect, not only on the mother but as well as the baby. I it has an effect on the respiratory centers of the fetus, it should drive respirations. Whether that has a long term effect, no one knows. The number of babies dying from SIDS has declined in recent years. Some attribute it to the fact that more parents are putting their babies to sleep on their backs rather than their sides or stomachs. Researchers say more studies are needed looking at the link between caffeine and SIDS. In the meantime, they suggest pregnant women stop or limit their coffee drinking to no more than a cup a day. ^Rhonda ^Rowland, _C_N_N, Atlanta.

 What does the international media have to say about the investigation into President Clinton? Steve ^Nettleton takes a look. To much of the world, the media feeding frenzy into the president's alleged sexual affairs has become an international soap opera. It has produced chuckles abroad from those who see it as another example of puritanical _U_S moral values interfering in government. Of course, the case goes beyond sex. It involves criminal accusations of lying under oath and trying to cover it up, allegations often overlooked by readers and viewers outside the United States. uh, I think they probably have a hard time uh making the distinction between the fact that on the one hand there is the sexual aspects of the scandal that are played up by the media, and on the other hand, the more serious charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. But in many countries, the idea of even questioning a president about his sex life is ridiculous. Late French president ^Francios ^Mitterrand carried on a long affair with a former campaign volunteer and fathered a daughter with her. Many in the French media knew about it, but kept it secret. th The people who did know ah choose not to report on it, because it was thought to be the private life of the president, and in no way had it anything to do with the way he was conducting the affairs of state. In Japan, politicians' sexual liaisons go largely ignored by the media and the public, as long as they are kept quiet. But if they become headlines, they can be politically damaging. In November, Japanese tabloids announced an alleged sexual affair between Prime Minister ^Ryutaro Hashimoto and a Chinese embassy employee in the nineteen eighties. The tabloids called the woman a Chinese spy and suggested the relationship was a threat to national security. Hashimoto denied the affair and it has had little effect on his office. One of his predecessors was not so lucky. Former Japanese Prime Minister ^Sousuke Uno resigned two months after taking office in nineteen eightynine following reports he had paid numerous hostesses called geishas to serve as his mistresses. Even then, the Japanese were more shocked that Uno didn't keep his mistresses quiet and the geishas' public complaints made him appear weak. Can Bill Clinton survive the whirlwind of lurid sexual details and criminal accusations swirling around the Oval Office? International leaders will be watching carefully, wondering whether it will set a new precedent for politicians worldwide. Steve ^Nettleton, _C_N_N, reporting.

 Wednesday Travelers may not be too comfortable with the _F_A_A's preparations for the year two thousand. ^Christine ^Negroni explains. Do you solemnly swear the testimony your The federal aviation administration, racing to update the nation's air traffic control system is already behind schedule. Outside experts told a congressional hearing that if progress continues to slip, the _F_A_A won't be ready for the new millennium until two thousand nine. i I think we have to be honest with ourselves. We are looking down the barrel of a potential disaster. How big of a disaster? A report from the general accounting office suggests it could be catastrophic. Onethird of the agency's critical air traffic control systems, those that direct planes in flight and notify pilots of potentially hazardous weather conditions, could fail if they are not renovated in time. _F_A_A needs to do a better job of managing this problem. We are behind, and that is unacceptable. Yet unlike everyone else who testified at the hearing, the _F_A_A administrator is positive the agency will be ready when the year nineteen ninetynine becomes two thousand. Aviation safety will not be compromised. Jane Garvey insists the current plan to push up by three years the purchase of new computers and an ongoing renovation of the software on old computers will ensure safe flight operations in the new millennium. But the _F_A_A will have to do more than make promises. In fact, doubters are already voicing their opinions. A survey of technology executives conducted by _C_I_O magazine showed half of those questioned expressed reservations about flying on the first day of the year two thousand. Airline executives are also pressuring the _F_A_A because no matter how successful the airlines are in updating their own operations, they remain dependent on the _F_A_A. In its report, the _G_A_O warns that should _F_A_A systems not be year two thousand compliant, the domino effect would be far reaching. Readying technology for the twentyfirst century is the highest profile challenge facing the _F_A_A. And anyone who gets on an airplane will be following its progress. ^Christine ^Negroni, _C_N_N, New York.

 The Arab League's secretary general is warning the United States a strike against Iraq could spark a dangerous reaction in the Arab world. As ^Brent ^Sadler reports, Iraqi president Saddam Hussein is banking on this kind of sentiment to prevent a _U_S attack. While Iraq stretches to breaking point the patience of Washington and London, president Saddam Hussein continues to capitalize on broadening diplomatic efforts to end the crisis, drawing heavily on France to push the case against the use of force among its European allies, and Russia as another major counterweight to the _U_S and British stand. Moscow's envoy in Baghdad, Viktor Posuvalyuk, remains in the Iraqi capital, pursuing efforts to work out an internationally acceptable plan allowing United Nations weapons inspectors access to presidential sites. The Arab league, whose secretary general last week met the Iraqi leader, says it will soon present a plan for a new _U_N security council resolution in coordination with Russia and France. The aim would be to avert air strikes and ensure Iraq meets _U_N demands. The Iraqi leadership accuses both the _U_S and Britain of ignoring a clamor against military action and appears encouraged by the intensifying diplomatic activity. President Saddam Hussein's eldest son, meanwhile, ^Udai, walking with difficulty after a nineteen ninetysix assassination attempt, made a rare appearance on Iraqi television. He was cheered on by members of the executive council of the general federation of Iraqi youth. Countering claims he's weak and suffering weight loss, he says he's on a special diet. His hair appears thin because it's cut short in case he's called to fight. And he offered his audience a further insight into his family's personal strategy towards the prospect of military conflict, saying his father has a habit of eating more in times of danger to demonstrate good health and to tease his enemies. _U_N arms inspections continue to function in areas where there's compliance. While Iraq seems prepared to throw open palace doors for a limited time under full international scrutiny, it falls short of _U_S and British demands. There is no deadline for president Saddam Hussein to relent in the face of increasing firepower in the gulf. But time is running out, according to latest British statements, with no backing down by Washington or London if Iraq refuses to change policy. Brent Sadler, _C_N_N, Baghdad.

 If you have unlimited access to America Online, you're going to be paying more. The price hike comes amid other changes at _A_O_L, as Steve Young tells us. America Online accelerated the all you can eat craze by offering unlimited internet service for nineteen ninetyfive a month. _A_O_L now plans to boost the cost of bellying up to the internet by ten percent starting in April. Most of us who closely follow the stock were expecting them to consider a price increase at the end of the year. I didn't think they'd try anything this soon. The price markup will come seven months after _A_O_L, the world's number one online service, bought the second biggest, Compuserve. Regulators acknowledge that the elimination of competitors often leads to higher consumer costs. If f folks are unhappy with _A_O_L's prices, they can s they can switch to other carriers, and I think that's an important point to be made. um But uh as as companies do consolidate, as industries consolidate, that is a problem. If you have a higher price than companies like _M_C_I, you might start to lose the market share war. In the long term, I think the higher price could hurt _A_O_L. _A_O_L may be calculating that while it's imposing a ten percent price hike most of its eleven million members will shrug at two dollars a month. It could be a miscalculation. I'm not all that crazy about the service. I may not pay that much more. There're so many problems with them right now that I'm willing to switch right now anyway.

 Black, white, young, old? If you've ever wondered what the population of the United States will look like in the future, look no further. Money magazine says it has the answer, and John ^Zarrella has the story. Hollywood, Florida. It's a lot like this gumball machine in the city's Rainbow Cafe. Filled with a nearly perfect mix. If you drive around Hollywood, uh you will not see that there's a latino quarter or a major asian quarter, things of that nature. They mix in and live and work with everyone else. According to a Money magazine survey, ethnic makeup is part of what makes this south Florida city, basically, the town that statistically most closely matches what the United States will be like in twenty five years. The magazine set out to find a preview of America's future. It found Hollywood, Florida, a town where the demographics mirror predictions for the whole United States in twenty twenty two. Seventeen percent of the city is hispanic, thirteen percent african american and two percent asian american. Sixty eight percent are white. The Rainbow Cafe is a twenty five year institution. Owner Jim ^Durfy remembers when his downtown restaurant was a watering hole for retirees, who, back in the seventies, were the city's population base. Now young professionals are buying into the city of the future. The mix of old and young, ^Durfy says, has energized the area. I think it's the people working together that helps downtown. People of all ages. In looking at age demographics, the survey found here, too, Hollywood represents the nation's future, tilted towards the old and the young. Twenty seven percent of the people here are over fifty five, twenty nine percent under twenty five, thirty one percent twenty five to forty four and just thirteen percent forty five to fifty four. Twenty five years from now, as we look out, we're going to be in a world that has a lot of older people and a lot of very young people, but not too many people in the middle. With south Florida's large hispanic and elderly populations, Hollywood as the recipe for the future is no surprise. And like the chef's special at the Rainbow Cafe, the mix is apparently serving up a healthy portion of prosperity. John ^Zarrella, _C_N_N, Hollywood, Florida.

 With a look at your _C_N_N headline news weather, I'm ^Karen Maginnis. Pacific moisture begins to move through the interior sections going into Friday morning. But by Saturday, an even stronger Pacific storm moves on shore. The rainfall could be heavy at times. This could aggravate the flooding across central and northern California once again. High pressure for the most part keeps things quiet from the southeastern _U_S and into the central plains. Overnight, we're expecting teen degree readings from Hudson bay into the interior west. By the afternoon hours on Friday, seventies in south Florida and the desert southwest. Sixties in southern California. In ^Anchorage, Alaska, expect twentyfive for a high and eightythree in San Juan. Our extended forecast coming up for Saturday, promises more heavy rainfall for the west coast, with some scattered showers across the Gulf coast region and into south Florida. We will still expect some fairly mild readings across the northern Rockies. On Sunday, a bit more active weather pattern. Even into Monday, pretty much widespread rainfall or rain showers.

 French police have examined a white ^Fiat private detectives believe might have been involved in the crash that killed princess Diana and two others.

 An uncertain future awaits Monica Lewinsky in the nation's capital. The former white house intern arrived back in Washington last night. Her attorney, ^Bill ^Ginsburg, says she wants to be near her mother, Marcia ^Lewis, who needed medical attention after being grilled for two days before the Whitewater grand jury. Sources indicate to _C_N_N, ^Lewis is upset at having to respond to tape recorded conversations in which her daughter details an alleged affair with president Clinton. ^Lewis' attorney says she needs time to rest before she testifies again. Lewi Lewinsky's attorney doesn't think it's a good idea though to put ^Lewis back on the stand. I am uh very concerned about Mrs. uh uh ^Lewis, and I think that her continued uh uh suffering, I have talked to her, is manifest. And I I just hope that uh they have the good sense and discretion not to put her back on the witness stand in the grand jury room uh next week. That would certainly be uh wise as far as I am concerned. And the lawyer for a retired secret service officer ^Lewis ^Fox is now disputing media reports his client saw the president and Lewinsky alone. The attorney says ^Fox remembers directing Lewinsky into the oval office once in nineteen ninety five, but he can't say they were alone. Fox says Lewinsky was delivering papers to the president.

 President Clinton says he is committed to a possible strike against Iraq, despite objections from other countries. Steve ^Hurst has that. The _U_S military buildup in the Persian gulf continues apace, more planes headed from the united states and senior officials say Iraq's president Saddam Hussein can expect punishing air strikes to continue well into the future if he doesn't stop building biological and chemical weapons. Saddam will know by our actions and our warning that we will be prepared to act again if we have evidence he is trying to rebuild his weapons of mass destruction capabilities. In a bit of television diplomacy, Iraq's deputy foreign minister responded from Baghdad in less than one hour, saying Washington would break international law by attacking without _U_N approval. The united states is not authorized to use force before going to the council. President Clinton, meantime, glossed over stern warnings from Moscow on Thursday that _U_S air strikes against Iraq could do serious harm to relations with the Kremlin. We're trying to find a diplomatic solution. And I hope that, whatever happens today, that our relationships with Russia will continue to be productive and constructive and strong, because that's very important to the future of our peoples. One contrary view of the issue presented itself to the president as he arrived in Philadelphia later in the day. Nevertheless, the president said Washington would use force if diplomacy fails to force Saddam Hussein to back down. The Russian foreign minister, meanwhile, sought to soften the harsh words of his military counterpart, saying on Friday that Russia now feels the _U_S must hold off at least until _U_N secretary general Kofi Annan visits Baghdad in a lastditch effort at diplomacy. Annan has no trip planned so far. Meanwhile, secretary of state ^Madeleine Albright, ^Berger and defense secretary William ^Cohen announced plans to travel to an unnamed city in the _U_S heartland next week, to explain to the American people just why military force will be necessary if diplomacy fails.

In fact, the romantic scene here is so bad that Hong Kong lovers have been rated worst in the world for the second year running, according to a global survey conducted by the condom maker ^Durex. If you ask people here why that's the case most will tell you it's because there's just not enough room for love and romance. Physical space here is limited and daily schedules are jam packed with financial affairs rather than affairs of the heart. And the financial turmoil of late hasn't made it any better. Many would be Romeos and Juliets are focusing even more on practical things. Some blame the men. Many of my male friends are too practical, says this woman. They avoid doing anything for Valentine's day like sending flowers or taking a girl out to dinner. Others blame the women. Hong Kong women can be very practical, too, says this man. Sometimes I get yelled at if I give them flowers. The woman would rather get the cash instead. Sounds heartless, but in Chinese culture, pragmatism often overrides romance. If you take the t traditional Chinese concept about love, then the Hong Kong business attitude is not going to harm it. Yeah you can go go t two things can go together. But if you go really with the western idea of love, then the two things are really contradictory. But let's not label all Hong Kongers as unromantic. There are some here who embrace the flower covered, chocolate laced, passion filled world of romance. These flowers are for my wife, says this romantic. I've been married for more than ten years now. I give her flowers every year. So on this valentine's day take a lesson even in the mad, mad world of Hong Kong there is always time for love and romance. ^May ^Lee, _C_N_N, Hong Kong.

Sales increased around the world even in Asia, where other tech companies have been hard hit by the economic crisis.

 This is _C_N_N Headline News, I'm David Goodnow. The standoff with Iraq will take center stage at the White House on Saturday morning. That's when national security advisers are scheduled to meet, according to Clinton administration officials. Iraq and the Iraqi crisis topped the united nations' agenda Friday. The _U_N security council +unanimously +okayed a resolution to more than double the amount of oil Iraq can sell for food and other humanitarian supplies. Council members hope the goodwill gesture will convince Iraq to pursue a path of peace. The measure was designed to ease the effects of seven years of _U_N sanctions. It is more than just a technical resolution. It is a clear message that we are not prepared to see the Iraqi people suffer as a consequence of the actions of their leaders, a message that we will do everything we can to see that their urgent humanitarian needs are met. _U_N secretary general Kofi Annan is expected to meet with more Iraqi leaders this weekend, Friday he spoke with Iraqi deputy president ^Tariq ^Aziz.

 Live from Atalanta, good evening Lynne Russell, _C_N_N headline news. New evidence is suggesting that a series of bombings in Atalanta and last month's explosion at an Alabama women's clinic might be related. Pierre Thomas has the latest. Atlanta nineteen ninetysix. A bomb blast shocks the Olympic games. One person is killed. January nineteen ninetyseven. Atlanta again. This time a bomb at an abortion clinic. More people are hurt. And just last month, an off duty policeman is killed when a bomb explodes at another abortion clinic. Location, ^Birmingham, Alabama. This man, ^Eric ^Rudolph has already been charged in the ^Birmingham bombing. Now officials are investigating whether, ^Rudolph, who remains at large, is linked to all three attacks. The reason, authorities have discovered tantalizing new evidence. Steel plates recovered at the Olympic park bombing appear to match those found at the abortion clinic bombing in Atlanta. Those plates may have come from a machine shop in north Carolina, where a friend of ^Rudolph worked. And nails found in the Atlanta abortion clinic bombing are identical to those discovered at ^Rudolph's storage shed in north Carolina. A senior law enforcement source tells _C_N_N, there is a lot of circumstantial evidence and it would be extraordinary to have all these bits and pieces and there not be a connection. And law enforcement sources say they can't ignore letters penned under the name army of god. Army of god is a secret organization that hates abortion providers, homosexuals and the _U_S government. Army of god letters claim responsibility for the Atlanta abortion clinic bombing, a nineteen ninetyseven attack on a gay lounge and the ^Birmingham assault. An intense manhunt conducted by the _F_B_I and the bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms continues for ^Rudolph in the wilderness of western north Carolina. And this week, _F_B_I director ^Louie ^Freeh assigned more agents to the search. ^Freeh also ordered the investigation consolidate information under the Atlanta task force, another indication officials suspect a link between all the bombings. Privately, authorities say ^Rudolph has become a focus of their investigation. Publicly, they are unwilling to make any sweeping assertion. The reason, they remember Richard ^Jewell. pierre thomas, _C_N_N, Washington.

 Good evening from Atlanta, Lynnene Russelll, _C_N_N headline news. president Clinton says the _U_N security council has sent a clear message to Iraqi, give international inspectors unrestricted access to all suspected weapons sites. The security council unanimously approved a resolution tonight endorsing the agreement with Iraq over _U_N weapon inspections. The resolution calls for the severest consequences if Baghdad violates the agreement. The unanimous vote came after several council members insisted on guarantees that it would not give automatic approval for a military strike if Iraq should break the accord. _U_N secretary general Kofi Annan says now it's up to Baghdad to hold up its end of the agreement. The government of Iraq fully understands that if this effort to ensure compliance through negotiation is obstructed by evasion or deception, as were previous efforts, diplomacy may not have a second chance. No promise of peace and no policy of patience can be without limits. We will live up to to this agreement. It's our agreement, it's it was not imposed by us, eh we reached this agreement eh through eh common understanding between us and Mr. Annan eh through wise eh diplomacy. It's a balanced eh agreement. eh There are a number of positive elements in it that will enable Iraq to eh prove eh what it has been saying.

In response to a subpoena from the independent counsel, I testified before the grand jury today. I answered all of their questions truthfully and completely, to the best of my ability. I shall return on Thursday for more questions.

That was true yesterday, that is true today and it will be true tomorrow. Jordan began helping Lewinsky find a job after she received a subpoena in the Paula Jones case.

 For years, Microsoft has been the closest thing to a sure thing on Wall Street. But ^Terry ^Keenan reports, that trend might be coming to an end. While Microsoft's chairman Bill Gates has been on the road, Microsoft stock has been on a tear. Until Wednesday, up thirty percent this year. Or four times as much as the _S and _P five hundred. At a rich fortyseven times earnings, is Microsoft stock too high? Ask the expert. I am very, very very conservative. ah You know, I've always viewed the stock price as being very high, even when it was a tenth of what it is today. It was just nineteen ninetytwo when Microsoft shares traded at a tenth of where they are today, just eight dollars back then, adjusted for splits. Since then, the stock has been the poster child of this bull market. A must own that can be found in one quarter of all mutual fund portfolios. I think the public thinks that they have to own Microsoft because they've heard of it. They think its a wonderful thing. But I don't think the public does the math. But some on Wall Street are crunching the numbers. Mary ^McCaffrey turned cautious last month. grow it's hard to to to pound the table, to run out and make aggressive buys. If the stock pulls back, then that gives you an opportunity to to to nibble at it or to build a position. But if you look at the um the _P _E and the the growth rate, you basically have a disconnect between the two. Here's the math, with a market capitalization of two hundred billion dollars, Microsoft is now the second most valuable company in America after General Electric. Yet it sold only eleven billion dollars in software last year. _G_E sold seven times as much. And while Microsoft is wildly profitable, the three billion dollars that hit its bottom line was five billion dollars less than _G_E earned in the same period. Of course Microsoft is no _G_E. Microsoft is growing at an incredible thirtyfive percent a year, and that's what investors are paying so dearly for. But if that growth slows, as it is at ^Intel, watch out. ^Terry Keenan, _C_N_N Financial News, New York.

A delta jet landing at Cleveland Hopkins airport today, skidded off the runway. One hundred forty people were on board. No one was hurt. Another storm system is moving into the Pacific northwest. Scattered snow is falling in the higher elevations.

 Phones are ringing off the hook in Brazil at least for a consortium of companies, including Atlanta based Bell South. The consortium got a stunning one point six million applications as part of its first raffle for cellular phone service in the capital, ^Sao ^Paolo. Brazil is seen as an emerging hot spot for telecommunications with just ten phone lines per one hundred people.

 From the frozen plains to the soggy south, winter is getting in one last lick across much of the _U_S. ^Dan ^Ronan looks at the different problems the cantankerous weather is causing. Sections of southern Georgia and Alabama are cleaning up flood damage, while other parts of the region are preparing for the worst. A week of heavy rains caused dozens of creeks and rivers to overrun their banks, often with devastating results. Residents in ^Elba, Alabama, along the ^Pea river, are already talking about rebuilding. People don't have anywhere else to go and. They just want to do what they can. Some, some are apprehensive about things right now, but uh but from what I've been hearing, people just want to, you know, pick up and go on with their lives. In ^Barnesville, Georgia, which used to be the horse buggy capital of the south, flood waters washed away a dam on a creek that supplies water to several communities. Crews are now trying to rebuild that dam. In the midwest, after an unusually mild winter, they're digging out from a fierce snowstorm. On a highway in ^Gary, Indiana, the visibility was so poor and the roads so slick, hundreds of drivers abandoned their cars and trucks for the nearest motels. Thousands of people are without power in northern Indiana and northern Illinois after wet snow and ice pulled down electric lines. We're looking at maybe two days, three days of power outage. In Cleveland, a delta airlines _M_D eightyeight jet with one hundred fortysix passengers and crew skidded off a runway at ^Hopkins international airport. No one was injured. The plane is being repaired. Now, if you're counting down, spring is just ten days away, so what's a midwesterner's fondest wish? Oh man, I was +so ready to go to the Caribbean. I'm telling you, I thought winter was done. Not just yet. ^Dan ^Ronan, _C_N_N reporting.

 You think you pay a lot to see a movie, wait until you hear how much it costs to make one. The motion picture association of America says the average studio produced film last year cost fiftythree point four million dollars. Up thirtyfour percent from the year before. Part of the reason for the average to go up is the two hundred million dollar price tag for Titanic.

 Although there's no rain today in the southeast, the flooding isn't over. In Albany, Georgia, the flint river may crest tomorrow. But it's not predicted to go as high as once believed. Eleven thousand people had to leave their homes. In ^Elba, Alabama, residents are cleaning up. The state attorney general is warning people to be careful of home repair fraud. A levee on Beaver Dam Creek broke in two places Sunday flooding the town.

 The internet has become big business for all sorts of companies. The young industry's rapid growth also is attracting regulators eager to police its many facets. ^Allan Dodds Frank has that story. Click in any direction. Book sales, pornography, gambling. Businesses are emerging on the Internet so quickly that no one, including government regulators, can keep track of them. We're dealing with something of such a massive uh size and potential impact, um that a lot of people wisely are saying hands off. Others, however, have seriously got their hands in the soup. That includes governors hungry for more tax revenue, despite a White House request for a moratorium on internet taxes. A national governors' association task force said, friday, it wants to find a way to recapture sales tax lost when people shop on the Internet instead of in stores. The net is just going to give us a whole different way of doing business. And we need to adjust our existing laws to make them compatible with new technology. There will have to be new public policies addressed along the way, in every area of its operation, from its financial operation, to its cultural impact. Governments at all levels are grappling with the Internet. The justice department is focusing on antitrust issues, including whether companies such as Microsoft or a combined worldcom _M_C_I are trying to monopolize Internet access. And the spread of Internet commerce is even causing alarm at the _C_I_A, the _F_B_I and the Pentagon. They want to block new encryption codes developed to secure Internet transactions. The agencies fear they will be unable to crack those codes to eavesdrop on spies and crooks. eh we should allow strong encryption on the Internet. And that means that there's going to be some people that're going to talk on there that we're not going to be able to hear. Pornography and gambling on the worldwide web draw the most calls for action. One senator wants to outlaw Internet gambling. and there are several areas in which the law has not kept pace with technology. This is one of them. Internet commerce barely existed five years ago. One estimate puts it this year at seventeen billion dollars, and its still in its infancy. So the problem for lawmakers is this. How to harness the Internet without hindering its development. ^Allan Dodds Frank _C_N_N Financial News, New York.

 A new _C_N_N, Time magazine poll finds Americans are drawing a broad definition of sexual harassment in the workplace. The poll asked is it sexual harassment if a boss asks an employee to have sex? Seventynine percent of those questioned said yes. Sixtysix percent say telling sexual jokes constitutes harassment. And fiftysix percent think it's harassment if a boss puts his or her arm around an employee, but people are split on whether flirting is harassment. when asked have we gone too far in making common interactions into cases of sexual harassment, fiftyfour percent said yes, thirtyfive percent no. There were no significant differences in the opinions of men and women to either question.

 The desks are broken, the windows smashed, and some students have to sit on the floor. Iraq's school system is literally falling apart. Peter Arnett reports, there's even deeper damage, problems that won't be so easy to repair. At ^Maala elementary in the ^Karaat district of Baghdad, Achmed is hard at work. A twelve year old, he's learning to read in a school that is literally falling apart. Iraq says sanctions have destroyed its once top rated education system. ^Maala elementary principle ^Hashim ^Khalaf says the school used to provide everything from textbooks and pencils to hot lunches. Now we need paper, books, furniture and all other necessities, he says. International organizations, including UNICEF, say Iraq's schools are deteriorating due to lack of funds. The organizations worry that poverty and declining educational standards will mean a lost future generation. The budget for social sectors is five to ten percent of what it used to be. Uh, obviously, uh, it has had a deterioration in, uh, access to education and quality of education. At ^Maala elementary, children share old books. Iraq says it can no longer provide new ones. Broken desks seat two and three students. Teachers say many children must sit on the floor. I have a class of fifty pupils, but with only fifteen desks, says this teacher. ^Dhuha ^Fawzi is only ten. She doesn't remember Iraq before sanctions. She hears schools were better then. the desks and windows are broken now, she says. With the state no longer providing, parents carry the costs of educating their children. But increasingly, poor mothers and fathers are pulling their kids out of school to save money. Iraq says schools will continue to deteriorate under the economic sanctions, now in their eighth year. And even if the sanctions were to be lifted soon, many worry that the damage to a generation of Iraqi children has already been done. Peter ^Arnett, _C_N_N, Baghdad.

 Here's Judy ^Fortin with today's edition of your health. a pregnant woman's growing belly is no longer a reason to take a nine month break from exercise. In fact, doctors now encourage expectant mothers to stay fit with approval from their physicians. Research shows women who exercise during pregnancy have more stamina while giving birth, shorter labors, and fewer caesarean sections. It's also a quicker way to return to prepregnancy weight. But mothers to be need to follow some guidelines. At the first trimester, you don't want to lay on your back or lay supine when you exercise. It's very important to exercise in a well ventilated space. Drink lots of fluid to dissipate all the heat that you generate. Be aware of your changing center of gravity and listen to your body while you exercise. If something is painful or makes you dizzy while working out, don't do it. For your health, Judy ^Fortin, _C_N_N Headline News.

 The nation's largest savings and loan, Washington Mutual, is buying one of its biggest rivals, _A_F ^Ahmanson. The price tag, nine point nine billion dollars in stock. You may remember, last year the two thrifts battled for control of Great Western Financial, a contest eventually won by Washington Mutual. As a result of today's deal, Washington Mutual will have nearly six million customers and nearly two thousand branches, but about one hundred sixty of them will be closed. About three thousand jobs will be eliminated because of the deal. ^Ahmanson stock is soaring on the news, up nearly twelve dollars while shares of Washington Mutual are losing a quarter.

 After finding evidence of a link between bombings in Atlanta and one in Birmingham, federal investigators have formally merged the task forces of those cities. Investigators found similarities between the explosion at a Birmingham women's clinic and bombs at a gay nightclub and a women's clinic in Atlanta. ^Eric ^Rudolph has been named the chief suspect in the Birmingham bombing, but not in the ones in Atlanta. Sources say combining the investigations was delayed because local authorities proposed a federal or opposed a federal proposal for a special prosecutor.

 I'm meteorologist Dave ^Hennen with your Headline News weather. A lot of heavy rain is anticipated over the next twentyfour hours in the southeast and the ground is already quite saturated. So some flooding is likely with some rainfall in the three to five inch range in parts of the southeast. Look for snow and ice through parts of northern New England. There are some winter storm watches in effect. And a storm system will be moving out of the Rockies after depositing some heavy snows in parts of Colorado into the plains by tomorrow. We take look at temperatures which today are going to be cold in the Rockies, only in the twenties in some areas, ranging to the seventies and eighties back down through south Texas and parts of Florida will see mild temperatures as well. A look at Alaska, Hawaii, the Caribbean. Nice weather through the Caribbean today, but high surf advisories are in effect for Hawaii. We take a look at th the extended forecast on Friday, showers and thunderstorms in the southeast. Be some snow back in the colder air through the Great Lakes and still mild conditions in the west. By Saturday, we begin to see rain chances in the Pacific northwest as rain continues in the northeast. And by Sunday, better chances for rain from northern California, northward, and more scattered showers in the northeast.
---------------------------
 I'm meteorologist Dave ^Hennen with your Headline News weather. Our forecast continues to show a couple of storms with more rain for the southeast, even a few strong to severe thunderstorms are possible over the next couple of days. Snow will be flying back through sections of the Midwest as low pressure tracks off towards the northeast, with high pressure and fair weather expected to continue much of the Western _U_S, at least temporarily. Forecast temperatures, warm in the southeast and in the southwest, in between it is cold back through the plains with highs only in the twenties and thirties. Alaska, Hawaii, the Caribbean. Expect some snow in ^Nome and in ^Barrow today. Look for nice weather in ^Hilo. Temperatures will be in the low eighties. We take a look at now your extended forecast. On Saturday, nice weather again, expected to continue back through the plains as temperatures uh continue to turn warm in the southwest. We will see some showers, though, rain continuing along the eastern seaboard, even some snow back through the Great Lakes. By Sunday, that storm continues in the northeast. We'll see some showers increasing in the northwest and northern California. More rain in the northwest during the day on Monday. And northern California, snow showers are expected back through the Great Lakes.

 -nd drugs to stand between _U_S students and their education. Today in Washington, he announced the results of a nationwide survey on school violence. He also says he's setting aside seventeen and a half million dollars for school safety projects. An education department survey found ten percent of schools report serious crimes that involve weapons, rape, or sexual assault. Fortyseven percent reported less serious crimes. Vandalism and fights, for example. But fortythree percent of schools reported no crime at all. The president says the threat of violence is all too real. When children have to worry more about guns and drugs than math and science, when teachers are more concerned with maintaining discipline than achieving excellence, when parents would rather keep their children at home than risk their safety at school, then we know we must do more. And if there is even one school in America where that is the case, we must all be committed to change it. The survey found the crime rate higher in larger schools and those in urban areas.

 This is _C_N_N Headline News. Good morning, I'm Linda ^Stouffer. It'll take a lot longer for people in the southeastern United States to rebuild their homes than it took for a series of tornadoes to destroy them. Recovery efforts continue today after the twisters tore through parts of Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia yesterday. FEMA director James Lee ^Witt is expected to survey tornado damage in northeastern Georgia tomorrow. A twister roared through an area about ten miles long there, killing at least fourteen people and turning dozens of homes into rubble. President Clinton has declared five counties federal disaster areas.

 There's an invisible pollutant in gasoline that clogs up catalytic converters and dirties the air. It's sulfur, and as Ed ^Garsten reports in today's edition of tech trends, the petroleum industry is proposing a cleanup. You can't see it, but sulfur is in every gallon of gas you pump in your car. The chemical impurity gums up antipollution devices, such as catalytic converters. On the average, there are three hundred and forty parts per million of sulfur in gasoline, except in California, where regulations mandate only thirty. Now the petroleum industry is proposing to lower sulfur content in gasoline sold everywhere, but not as low as in California. Why should drivers in clean air states like Iowa or Wyoming pay for California style gasoline when they would be better served with a lower priced, more conventional gasoline that still produces environmental benefits? the proposal calls for cutting sulfur levels in half to a hundred and fifty parts per million in gas sold in seventeen states where air quality is a problem. Gas sold in every other state except California would have a reduced sulfur content of three hundred parts per million. The proposal by the petroleum industry, though, is at odds with what the nation's big three auto makers are demanding. They want sulfur content in all gasoline to be as low as California levels. We need those clean fuels like they have in California nationwide so that all citizens can get the benefit of cleaner air and that all of our cars and trucks will be able to run with more reliability on the fuel that's in the marketplace. Detroit plans to introduce vehicles with more efficient antipollution devices as soon as next fall. But the automakers say those devices will work better with California type gasoline. Well there's no argument over who will pay the price for lowering sulfur levels in gasoline. That's right, the consumer. Estimates range anywhere from a penny to twenty cents more a gallon of gas. Some drivers we spoke with say their pockets are only so deep to save the environment. A couple of cents, I mean not a lot. Five would be good, but no more than that. Indeed. While the federal government will ultimately decide the issue, the consumer will ultimately pay. Ed ^Garsten, _C_N_N, Detroit.

 Researchers say they're working on a custom made cancer vaccine and a birth control pill for men. ^Sherry ^Rauh has these stories and more in this edition of the week in health. It's been an exciting week on the cancer fighting front. Doctors in Philadelphia announced they're experimenting with vaccines against ovarian cancer. The shots are custom made from tumors removed from individual patients. The tumor cells are treated with a chemical that makes them alien enough to energize the immune system. Each dose of vaccine is prepared for the patient the day they go in for their shots. The theory that I subscribe to is that every cancer is different and it's also possible that every cancer in every patient is different. As for one of the most common cancers in men, there's an extraordinary discovery about an ordinary vitamin. The National Cancer Institute found thirtytwo percent fewer cases of prostate cancer among men taking vitamin _E. And there were fortyone percent fewer deaths from prostate cancer among those men. Researchers say vitamin _E also appears to provide some protection against colorectal cancer and lung cancer.

 If your exercise routine is too routine, consider cross training. Rotating several different fitness activities on different days or within the same workout. Crosstraining does more than help keep you from getting bored. Over time, your body adapts to a single exercise, becoming more efficient, which means you burn less calories. If you decide crosstraining is for you, alternate high impact activity, such as running or aerobics, with lower impact workouts like cycling or stair climbing. That lets your joints and muscles recover for the next high impact session. For every few days of aerobics and other energy based exercises, throw in a day of strength training. Working with weights gives your tendons, ligaments and muscles the strength they need to keep exercise injury free, and helps you maintain lean body mass and weight loss. And when you change to a new activity, start with a shorter workout at a lower difficulty level than usual, allowing your body to become accustomed to the new stress gradually.

 And the Oscars are over. Titanic wrote eleven academy awards on board tying the record Ben Hur set back in nineteen fiftynine. Jack ^Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Kim ^Basinger, and Robin Williams also won academy awards. More news in fifteen minutes.
---------------------------
 The man at the helm of Titanic is setting records of his own. James ^Cameron won three statuettes at the Academy Awards on Monday. Dennis Michael talked with him about what makes Titanic sail. I'm the king of the world. James ^Cameron may not be a world ruler, but his crown as the reigning king of Hollywood is pretty secure following Monday night's Oscar gala. He came home with three personal Oscars for editing, for best director and, of course, best picture, something that has never happened before in Oscar history. Hollywood's King James the first still finds his position at the pinnacle something of a surprise. There's a certain aspect of how the hell did this happen? You know, um because i it sort of uh goes against everything you think you know. uh Not that I didn't believe in the picture, I did. But I I certainly never thought that it would enter these, you know, higher strata. uh And I don't think anyone did, quite frankly. I mean, we thought you know, we'll break even, make a little money, and we'll have felt good, very worthwhile doing it, but nothing like this. For Titanic, it was a virtual parade of winners Monday night. The film's art direction, costumes, sound and sound effects, music and song were all honored, as were the heroic visual effects. But ^Cameron says no single element, even his script or direction, is responsible for Titanic's success. It's greater than the sum of the parts. The spectacle alone would not do it. The love story alone would not do it. A love story, as separated from Titanic, would not have been a as powerful. A Titanic story without the love story to give you an investment in it would not have been as powerful. But you put it all together and it's doing something u t clearly to the hearts of audiences in all cultures, you know, everywhere. It's a chemistry of the elements. And if you take one thing away, there's a diminishment. You take another thing away, there's a diminishment. You put them all together, and you achieve an effect that's, you could call it a synergistic effect. And ^Cameron's acceptance speech at Monday night's academy awards may have been a first. He asked for a moment of silence to remember the souls lost aboard the real Titanic in nineteen twelve. But an awareness of the reality of the tragedy has always been at the heart of the effort to bring Titanic to the screen. The film does, you know, uh try to embrace a kind of uh a kind of noble spirit. And that that's a lot of what is intriguing about Titanic as a, as a subject, and I, uh, you know, y you want to try to live up to that. And I think that that's a lot of what was going on during the making of the film, too, for the, for the crew, for the people involved. We were all trying to live up to the the subject. Oscar night caps a titanic achievement for James ^Cameron. Dennis Michael, _C_N_N Entertainment News, Hollywood.

 Your Headline News weather forecast for Saturday calls for rain and thunderstorms to move from the plains states into the upper Midwest. And then we'll see some more developing late in the day across the western plains states. The east will be warm and windy, while the west is wintry. We could see snow as far south as the mountains of southern California, perhaps even in the foothills of Los Angeles County. Look for a foot of snow in the Sierra Nevada. Perhaps into the mountains of northern Arizona as well. Temperaturewise, seventies and eighties from southern New England to the Gulf Coast. Just thirties and forties over much of the northwestern part of the country. Looking ahead then to Sunday, we'll see rain and thunderstorms from the Great Lakes to the southwest, with the warm weather continuing in the east. On Monday, it'll still be warm across most of the east, with rain and thunderstorms from the Great Lakes, rainshowers and mountain snow into the southwest. Finally, on Tuesday, wet in the east, with showers in the northwest. Temperatures begin to moderate across the country as well. This is meteorologist Valerie ^Voss from the _C_N_N weather center.

 If you're heading to the video store this weekend, check this out first. Dennis Michael has the home video preview. But, they all died in the lab. Yes, Susan. But you let them out. They do make them like they used to, and in many ways better. Mimic stars a very effective ^Mira ^Sorvino in a science fiction monster movie that harks back to some of the very best of the genre. This time, a strain of insects created to destroy a plague spread by roaches survives to choose a new victim, us. This movie is genuinely creepy, big fun. Somebody sent this to me. Oh, my God, somebody knows Helen. How? I don't know. Julie, we were so careful. I know what you did last Summer is from the same mold and same writer as scream and scream two. Where's Freddy ^Krueger when you need him? Brace yourself. Over on the made for video rack is Batman and Mr. Freeze, Subzero. Live action movie Batman and Robin wasn't nearly as well written as this animated adventure. The moody animation style has been supplemented with some very impressive computer animation techniques to deliver a much more authentic Dark Knight than the multimillion dollar Joel ^Schumacher versions. See you at the rental counter. Dennis Michael. _C_N_N Entertainment News Hollywood.

 Now this look at your health. Radon is a natural radioactive gas that can seep from the earth into your home. A study by the national research council says radon is linked to nearly twentytwo thousand lung cancer deaths a year in the United States. And most of the victims are smokers. Smokers who are exposed to radon appear to be at greater risk for developing lung cancer, because the effects of smoking and radon are more powerful when the two factors are combined. Radon is everywhere. The Environmental Protection Agency plotted its different concentrations across the United States. The _E_P_A recommends home owners test for high levels of radon gas and take measures, such as fixing cracks in the basement, to help block that natural seepage and reduce the risk to your health.

 With a look at your _C_N_N Headline News Weather, I'm Karen Maginnis. A storm system moves across southern California and into the four corners region, with some wet weather, low snow levels and breezy conditions. Temperatures will be a bit suppressed for this time of year. The temperatures in the northeast and New England will fall back into the sixties and seventies thanks to the passage of a frontal system. This is an area that has seen some record setting levels over the last several days. Overnight lows will be the coldest from the Northwest into the four corners and towards the Midwest, where we did see some blizzard conditions across portions of the Dakotas. By the afternoon hours for Wednesday, very mild from Texas to Florida. Chilly through the Great Lakes and the Northwest and into the Great Basin. In Anchorage, Alaska, look for a high of thirtyfive degrees. Should be about eightythree in Honolulu, eightyfive in the forecast for San Juan. In the extended forecast we're watching those temperatures rebound across the northern plains, shooting back up into the sixties, even into Friday. But thunderstorms will be rumbling around the Gulf Coast region. And on Saturday, a stormy forecast both for the east and west coasts.

 First a glut of economic reports released this morning as stocks hover near that break even point. Right now the Dow Jones industrials are up three points at eightyeight oh three after sagging fifty points earlier in the session. The broader markets are mostly higher with the technology having NASDAQ composite up fractionally, building on its new record set yesterday. Shares of Zenith Electronics plummeting two at four and fiveeighths after the _T_V maker posted another quarterly loss and warned that it may face bankruptcy. The bond market modestly higher. The thirty year treasury is up two thirtyseconds of a point in price, the yield at five point ninetythree percent. Not much movement in the bond market following a string of economic reports. They show a robust economy and low inflation despite the financial crisis in Asia. The National Association of Purchasing Management index rose in March, indicating the manufacturing sector is growing at a faster rate than economists expected. The housing industry continues to boom, with construction spending in February increasing threetenths of one percent for the third straight month. And the conference board releasing its index of leading indicators. That measure predicts future economic activity, and it jumped four tenths of one percent in February.

 Independent counsel Kenneth ^Starr may be considering a new strategy in his investigation of President Clinton. Bob ^Franken has the story. With the Paula Jones case set aside, at least for now, independent counsel Ken ^Starr is deciding exactly how he will pursue the allegations against the president and his associates. The crimes that we have been charged with, uh, investigating are +subordination of perjury, intimidation of witnesses and obstruction of justice. Sources tell _C_N_N, ^Starr's office is discussing a tough new approach. Some of his more aggressive prosecutors are recommending he indict Monica Lewinsky and name President Clinton an unindicted coconspirator in an alleged coverup. While the conventional wisdom has been that ^Starr would turn over his findings to congress, the new scenario would give him a better opportunity, advocates argue, to publicly air evidence against the president. Lewinsky would be charged with perjury and +subordinating perjury for trying to get Linda ^Tripp to lie under oath during her deposition with Paula Jones' attorneys. One hitch, sources say, is the fight with Lewinsky's lawyer over his claim she has already been offered a binding immunity deal which would preclude this scenario. That fight is awaiting a ruling by the presiding judge. ^Starr continued to push his investigation calling White House chief of staff ^Erskine ^Bowles before the grand jury. The real question that we're examining is, wh were crimes committed? But some lawyers challenge whether ^Starr still has grounds to continue this probe because of the Jones ruling. Among them, a former independent counsel. Under the federal statutes, even though a person lies under oath or gets somebody else to lie under oath, unless it's material, unless it hurts someone, it's not, not prosecutable. There are also still several important witnesses yet to appear before the grand jury, including Linda ^Tripp, and Lewinsky, depending on the immunity fight. And there's Kathleen ^Willey. _C_N_N has learned that she was scheduled to give another deposition in her home town of Richmond to Paula Jones' attorneys this Saturday over the objections of ^Starr. That problem has gone away. Bob ^Franken, _C_N_N, Washington.

 Federal agents are accusing an assistant middle school principal of negotiating a drug deal at his school in North Miami, Florida. Robert ^Vito reports. The man in this police surveillance video is Willie Young, a highly respected member of this community in North Miami and has been assistant principal of this middle school for the past thirteen years. A few minutes after these pictures were taken, Young was arrested by agents for the _D_E_A. The _D_E_A says Young is a drug dealer, and its undercover agents negotiated a deal to sell him large amounts of cocaine. They delivered thirty kilos of cocaine to the place Young allegedly wanted it. Here at the school. We began negotiations with Willie Young here at this school. uh Mr. Young always selected the sight and always insisted on negotiations being conducted here at the school. Willie Young says he's innocent, and just went along with what he thought was a joke. The guy came to my job. He called me. I was not trying to knock on nobody's door or set up any type of deal. The _D_E_A says it's been investigating Young for the past two and a half years. Investigators say he's part of a massive trafficking network in south Florida. He was connected with Louis ^Cano, uh a drug trafficker that we arrested and uh convicted several months ago, couple of months ago. uh Mr. Young was actually one of the distributors. True entrapment. True entrapment. The _D_E_A says the thirty kilos of cocaine it delivered to Young were headed to the streets of Miami and Fort Lauderdale. Meanwhile, students at Young's school were stunned by the arrest of their assistant principal. I can't believe that he would do something like this. Because he's, you know, such a nice guy. He was supposed to be a role model to us and then he just sh he just let everybody down. i It's very sad. add to it, may God bless him. May God bless his soul. Authorities say if Young is convicted on all the charges they plan to bring against him, he could face twenty years in federal prison without the possibility of parole.

 Worldclass skiers say balance is everything. Now a new device is helping skiers save precious time going downhill. Rick ^Lockridge reports, it also helps nonskiers freeze pain in its tracks. Going for his fiftieth world cup victory. For world cup skiers like Alberto ^Tomba, the difference between winning and finishing back in the pack is often a single, thin second. Now this is a different slalom course than they have used in the past. Or less. At this level, the slightest edge in speed and balance can crown a champion. While the tiniest technical flaw can be costly. Out of the race course. Seeking that tiny but decisive competitive edge, many of Italy's Olympic skiers come here to the laboratorio alto prestazione, the high performance lab, in Santa Caterina, Italy. What they're asked to do here literally makes their jaws drop. Changing the bite is just one of many modes that you can use to help you to eliminate the interferences. And this silver and green box is what finds the problem. It's the lizard med scale, a scale that measures precisely where your weight is distributed. It can show you exactly where you're out of balance. When world cup downhiller ^Pitro ^Vitialini steps on the scale, it shows him to be several pounds heavier on the right side of his body, as shown by the red lines. A decision is made to give ^Pitro a custom mouthpiece, in the hope his jaw will line up properly, and the rest of his body will follow. We adjusted my bite. And in effect, I improved my performance quite a bit. And so I believe in the system. Athletes aren't the only ones affected by body imbalances. Ordinary people are, too. Hold it. Resist. Very good. Chiropractor ^Alfio ^Caronti says the lizard med scale allows patients to see for themselves the alignment problems that are causing their pain or injury. So, the scale has been uh helping to show that uh w we're seeing the truth. Open the lizard med scale and you find six sensors. Three for each foot. The sensors feed data into a software program which can actually calculate the body's posture. Green readouts indicate good balance, yellow means you're on the border, and red means you're really out of It's not like I get on that scale, they tell me what's wrong, and all of a sudden, I'm a better skier. But the information that I get allows me to achieve better balance, and if I can continue to maintain that balance, I ski better. Someday soon, even ordinary skiers and nonskiers may find themselves standing on the green lizard like marks that give this promising device its name. Rick ^Lockridge, for _C_N_N, Santa Caterina, Italy.

 Despite today's rebound in technology shares, one stock not faring in the rally or sharing in the rally, I should say, is chip maker Advanced Micro Devices. Late yesterday, the company reported a fiftyfive million dollar loss for the first quarter. And that compares with an almost thirteen million dollar profit for the same period a year ago. However, the company also said that long persistent production problems with its _K six microprocessor have largely been corrected. Investors are still punishing _A_M_D stock, however, which is falling two and ninesixteenths, at nearly twentyeight.

 _C_N_N Headline News, I'm Chuck Roberts. Welcome. Good afternoon. It's anything but a good Friday for folks in the storm socked southeastern states. Still digging through debris from the Wednesday night tornadoes. Vice president Al Gore got a _V_I_P view of damaged areas today. The FEMA director, Federal Emergency Management chief, James Lee ^Witt accompanied him. Fortythree people were killed in storms that ravaged Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. Winds reached two hundred sixty miles per hour, now, we've learned, ripping apart brick houses and peeling the bark off trees. Gore says it's the worst damage he's ever seen from any tornado. He calls it virtually unprecedented, and says the government's response must be unprecedented as well. Vice President Gore and I have been to many disaster scenes together. And each time that we go, and w each time that we work with the state and local communities, we have seen a partnership come together that can make a difference in families' and neighbors' and communities' lives. And we've seen these communities come back and build back stronger than they were ever before. So you will recover. You will come back stronger. And we will be here to help you. Gore wrapped up his tour with a flyover of storm damaged areas in metro Atlanta.

 Longtime adversaries showed their approval today of an agreement aimed at bringing peace to northern Ireland. Negotiators hammered out the deal after a thirtytwo hour marathon meeting. The agreement calls for a one hundred eight member assembly in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and the creation of a cross border council linking Northern Ireland with the Irish Republic. Some issues remain unresolved, and British prime minister Tony Blair cautioned the deal is just a framework. Sinn Fein leader ^Gerry Adams called the agreement positive. These negotiations and the new arrangements which result from them are part of our collective journey from the failures of the past towards a future together as equals. Our party remains absolutely committed to our Irish Republican objectives. We will continue to pursue these objectives in the months and the years ahead. And a united Ireland can make that case now by persuasion, not violence or threats. There is recognition and acceptance of the nationalist identity. There are plans for cooperation, including through implementation bodies, on an all Ireland basis. And there can be further developments of such bodies again should consent be there for them. There are provisions for fairness, and for equality, for recognition that all traditions in Northern Ireland are valid and deserve respect and dignity.

 With a look at your _C_N_N Headline News Weather, I'm Karen Maginnis. Saturday morning, it starts out terrific, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast, into the northeast and New England. Though there will be cooler conditions here, there is a gradual warming trend that takes place throughout the weekend. Backtoback frontal systems impact much of the western United States with cooler readings, rainfall and fairly low snow levels for this time of year. It's also going to be chilly overnight into the northeast and New England and across the eastern provinces of Canada with readings only in the twenties. The _L_A basin, by Saturday afternoon, experiences temperatures only in the sixties, and forties and fifties for the Pacific northwest and the great basin. Lots of seventies into the central plains from Texas to Florida into Kansas and Nebraska and across Missouri. Anchorage, Alaska, will be cloudy and fortyseven. And look for variably cloudy skies and showers for San Juan, and eightyfive degrees, windy across the Hawaiian islands. On Saturday, still cool readings in the Pacific northwest. Heavy rain develops on Monday across the midwestern United States. And we could see some strong thunderstorms in the southeast by Tuesday.

 We're hearing dire predictions these days about the future of social security, but Bruce ^Morton wonders just how concerned people really are about America's retirement program. Social security. We worry about it. The president held a town meeting about it. Can it be fixed? I think they'll come up with something. I think they will. In the latest _C_N_N Time poll fewer than a third of our sample thought there was a crisis in social security, but most said there were problems. Experts agree. The American people realize the nature and magnitude of the problem. That uh it's not a crisis, the world isn't going to come to an end, but it is something that has to be fixed in the near future. One popular suggestion. Give people some of what they pay in to invest themselves, in stocks, say. Sixty percent of our sample liked that. So I think y you should have the uh privilege to take your money an and the taxes that you uh that y you're spending to use it for what you want and to, uh, to invest it in the economy just makes everything better. Trouble is, says ^Reischauer, that may be a good idea, but it won't bring the system into balance. Some point, uh, we're going to have to face reality, and the reality is, that uh benefits will have to be shaved a bit, or uh taxes will have to be raised, uh and there's no getting around that. But when we asked, how about raising taxes, raising the retirement age, or cutting benefits, the people in our poll lopsidedly said, no. So, will social security go bankrupt before you retire? People over fifty in our poll said no. People eighteen to thirtyfour fairly overwhelmingly said yes. But many thought they'd get by anyway. I think I personally would. Definitely, I do. Especially with the new Roth _I_R_A, I can start that now and then be all right. Optimists. Maybe they're right. Bruce ^Morton, _C_N_N, Washington.

 Some animals are observing Passover, and they may not be very happy about it. The residents of Jerusalem's biblical zoo are eating Kosher for the next week. Zookeepers are depriving elephants and hippos of their usually daily diet of ten loaves of bread.

 You're paying more at the gas pump, but it's still not a bad deal. The latest national survey of gasoline prices said the average is up about three cents a gallon, to a dollar ten. Industry analyst ^Trilby ^Lundberg says recent cost cutting produced unrealistically low prices, and major oil exporting countries have announced cuts in output. Prices are still about eighteen cents lower than they were a year ago.

 It's tax time even at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue. President and Mrs. Clinton released their nineteen ninetyseven tax returns Monday. The Clintons reported five hundred sixtynine thousand dollars in adjusted gross income. They're paying just less than ninetytwo thousand dollars in federal income taxes. Two hundred thousand dollars in earnings comes from the presidential salary. The Clintons earned two hundred eightyone thousand dollars in other income, including royalties from Mrs. Clinton's book, It Takes a Village. All of those proceeds went to charity. The rest came from investments and other odds and ends. If you look at, at, um, the w their wage income it's uh it is not two hundred thousand, which as you all know is the president's salary, but two hundred thousand seventysix. And that seventysix uh is still uh his residuals from uh his appearance on uh the Arsenio Hall Show back in ninetytwo. Vice president and Mrs. Gore show earnings last year of one hundred ninetyseven thousand dollars. Their federal tax bill is fortyseven thousand dollars.

 Vice president Al Gore says the government has a plan to avoid the inevitable prospect of increased airplane crashes and fatalities. ^Carl ^Rochelle reports. The forecast is grim. Boeing aircraft says unless safety is improved, there could be one major airline crash a week worldwide by twenty fifteen. The Clinton administration says it's taking steps to reduce those odds. We can't allow that rise in the number of crashes that would come without the action. So we have to do everything we can to make air travel even safer. And to reduce mechanical and human failures that can lead to disaster. Vice President Gore announced several safety initiatives. One would deal with the situation where a crew for unknown reasons, flies a perfectly good plane into the ground. That's what happened at the recent Korean Airline's crash on Guam. Referred to as control flight into a terrain, it was the leading cause of accidents between nineteen eightyseven and ninetysix, claiming nearly twentyfour hundred lives. The White House is ordering all airlines to begin using enhanced ground proximity warning devices within three years. The new system uses global satellite navigation and terrain mapping to provide increased warning time. Pull up. Pull up. Pull up. The administration is also attacking uncontained engine failures, that's when a part of the engine breaks off and penetrates the cabin or damages a critical part of the plane causing a crash. With the help of engine manufacturers joining together for the first time, we know, now know, how to bring down the rate of accidents caused by uncontained engine failures by forty percent. Aviation industry experts call the plan a step in the right direction. We're addressing issues that are major, such as controlled flight into terrain and uh some of the technology is is already being used. And it wil, will simply be put on more aircraft, and that's a very good idea. Boeing stands by its forecasts of one accident a week by twenty fifteen, but says the White House action may help. That's the whole reason that we're doing this. um We know that with traffic growth that if you have the same accident rate, then you're going to have more accidents. The safety issues are not new, but the increased emphasis is. And with the number of passengers at _U_S airports expected to grow to a billion a year by twenty ten, experts say now is the time to act to head off more serious problems in the future. ^Carl ^Rochelle, _C_N_N, the White House.

 Just days after millions of Americans filed their income tax returns, the debate over the tax system is heating up again. There are differing opinions on the socalled flat tax, which could be filed on a postcard, but would eliminate many deductions, including charitable contributions. One of the things that distinguishes American life are the private sector charities. eh the colleges, the hospitals, the the Red Cross. These things mean so much to us and you would just about wipe out With a flat tax, with people able to keep more of what they earn, you would have more charitable giving. The American people do not need to be bribed by the tax code to be charitable. The +flat tax plan was the centerpiece of ^Forbes' presidential campaign in nineteen ninety six.

 A family spokesman says he misled the public about where Linda McCartney died to protect the family's privacy. The initial family statement indicated she had died in Santa Barbara, California, on Friday from breast cancer that had spread to her liver. But according to published reports, Linda McCartney probably died at the family ranch in Arizona. California officials are investigating where she died because a Santa Barbara county coroner wasn't notified, and a death certificate or cremation certificate wasn't issued there. Death certificates in Arizona are not public record. A family friend says Paul McCartney is calling reports of assisted suicide ludicrous. That is just uh n uh n nonsense, because uh I know for a fact that Linda was on a new treatment and it was a hopeful one. It would never have cured her, but it certainly would have held back her dying. And I don't think that a family who would go to that trouble to have started a course of treatment would assist her to die, nor, knowing Linda the way I did, would she dream of dying before her time. She was too brave for that. In a statement to the British Press Association, Paul McCartney says, our family has received many beautiful messages of sympathy from ordinary people around the world. Reading their messages we know that ordinary people would want our request for simple privacy to be respected. This is a personal request from me.

 Affordable health care insurance could soon be going the way of the family doctor. The New York Times reports that some insurers are considering raising rates for managed care an average of seven percent nationwide next year. Employees in New York, New Jersey, California, Illinois and Minnesota could see premiums go up as much as ten percent. Managed care companies say increases are needed to offset huge losses last year. Critics, though, say the increase undermines the basic appeal of the system. I'm sure some increase is justified. But over ten percent? uh They had claimed that they were going to save uh money for employers and for consumers into the future. There seemed to be a one time savings, but now their costs are going way sky high, and uh it doesn't look very fair to me. Last year, eightyfive percent of employees were enrolled in managed care plans.

 But first, one taxpayer told the Senate Finance Committee today armed _I_R_S agents literally stormed his business and ordered his employees to back away from their computers. The Panel today heard testimony from three people during the second day of its probe into allegations of _I_R_S abuses. One of them says he believes the _I_R_S acts with a military mentality. It was a terrible strain on me, my family and my employees. The entire case of the _I_R_S against me would extract a terrible toll. It was the intent of the _I_R_S to break me emotionally and financially over what eventually would be a total of thirtythree months so that I would plead guilty to at least one count each of bankruptcy and tax fraud. _I_R_S commissioner Charles ^Rossotti says the allegations are very serious. He vows to make the agency less intrusive and more user friendly. I have already taken some strong steps to deal with uh the most important disciplinary cases at the _I_R_S. It is essential that the _I_R_S conduct itself properly in all dealings with taxpayers, including criminal investigations. To that end, since becoming commissioner, uh I have repeatedly stressed the need for openness and accountability at the _I_R_S in all of its dealings. ^Rossotti is scheduled to appear before the Senate panel on Friday. And the full Senate may vote on a bill next week that would revamp the tax collection agency.

 People sometimes wear jewelry to bring out their features. ^Jeanne ^Moos shows us a piece of jewelry that lets folks know how you feel, and this one puts that old mood ring to shame. It would make a fine gift for a female cardiologist. I can't see down there, is it beating? my brooch. But if this brooch stops beating, better call nine one one. It's beating to my heartbeat. Oh, cool. Harry ^Winston Jewelers on Fifth Avenue prides itself on selling rare jewels of the world. But it's a really rare jewel that requires you to strap on electrodes. Bare skin, below the nipples. The electrodes transmit your heartbeat to this receiver, which activates light emitting diodes that make the six red rubies pulse surrounded by diamonds. We'll see if it's accurate. Wow, it really does match. They don't call it the heartthrob brooch for nothing. Good idea? Dumb idea? We I think it's stupid. what is it don't get the point.

We had to have a security man accompany us as we showed the brooch to folks on Fifth Avenue. We let this woman wear it. Am I beating? You're beating to my heart. Is anything happening? Is it going faster? I can I can't really eh tell. Well, you could tell after doing a set of situps. This is before, this is after. The mere sight of someone attractive would not make your heart beat faster, really. I mean, that's just what you see in the movies. Could. Will you end up like _E_T, extra transparent? Well, a stranger's hug had no impact. nor did the sight of a handsome man. So much for that experiment. But when the heartthrob brooch was first introduced, ^Leonard ^Nimoy, alias Mr. Spock Do you know anything about vulcans? Got to kiss a model. Both were wired. and both their hearts raced.

 On international matters, the President urged the Senate to pass a treaty to expand NATO. The Senate may vote on that by the end of the day. The debate over NATO enlargement has been a model of bipartisan action. I hope for a strongly positive vote in the Senate later today because by admitting Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, we come even closer than ever to realizing a dream of a generation, a Europe that is united, democratic and secure for the first time since the rise of nation states on the European continent.

 You've seen it, you may have done it. Now the federal government is calling for a crackdown on drivers who speed through red lights and stop signs. The transportation department says aggressive drivers accounted for eightysix hundred deaths in crashes in intersections in nineteen ninetysix. Twentysix hundred were killed in wrecks where drivers ran red lights. Six thousand were killed in crashes in which drivers ignored stop signs. Transportation secretary ^Rodney ^Slater says a pilot program to educate drivers about these dangers will be expanded in the country. He says the program has reduced red light accidents by fortythree percent in some communities.

 President Clinton presented his childcare proposal today calling for nearly twentytwo billion dollars to help working parents find quality care for their children. The plan would give childcare tax breaks to parents and businesses and provide more money for states and programs that train and supervise caregivers. The President says his plan would extend subsidized childcare to about two million American children.

 The _U_N's chief weapons inspector says his monitoring teams will go ahead with their work as planned despite Iraq's threat to block a team led by an American. Iraqi officials claim team leader Scott ^Ritter, an American, is a spy, and they say his team has too many Americans and Britons on it. ^Ritter, a former Marine captain who served in the Persian Gulf War, denies the charge.

 This is The World, a coproduction of the _B_B_C world Service, Public Radio International, and _W_G_B_H Boston. I'm Eddie ^Mair in London. And I'm Tony ^Kahn in Boston. As a British negotiator to the northern Ireland peace talks put it today, the clock is ticking. As the violence there increases, politicians have resumed the search for peace in the Britishruled province. When the negotiators ended their previous meeting a month ago, they hadn't even agreed on an agenda. But today the British and Irish governments, which cosponsored the talks, presented a proposal setting priorities. The suggestions have been made before but the plan, if accepted, would clear the first hurdle on the course to a peace settlement for northern Ireland. In Belfast, the _B_B_C's Tom ^Coulter has been following the day's events and assesses the proposals. Well the main thrust of the proposals are tha that, first of all, there will be discussion and negotiation about Constitutional change. Now, that will take in the Irish government's a articles two and three of their constitution, which lays claim to jurisdiction over northern Ireland, but it also brings in the _U_K government's ah government of Ireland act which actually partitioned northern Ireland from the rest of the island back in the twenties, so all things are there are up for grabs an and for negotiation. There's also a new intergovernmental tier being implemented. uh It will address the totality of relations between the two islands and certainly it would bring in the new uh Scottish Parliament which is to be, to be formed, the new Welsh assembly which is also to, to be elected and also th m a northern Ireland assembly which will be uh voted for on proportional representation grounds and then the two sovereign governments. So it will be an umbrella body which will oversee the totality of relationships between the two islands. Tom, is there enough here to keep the nationalists happy, those people who want a united Ireland, but also to appease the Unionists, the people who want to remain part of the United Kingdom? Two positions which appear to be irreconcilable. Well, they would seem to be to most outsiders and certainly with the constitutional change as put forward, or the a possibility of constitutional change. That wi will pro provide difficulties for all sides because obviously the unionists, as you say, want to s, they are proBritish, they want to remain part of the United Kingdom. The republicans want a united Ireland. But that's there on the table. Everything is on the table. They can negotiate it. And I suppose at the end of the day it's what consent is agreed and I suppose there are elements within John ^Hume's _S_D_L_P who perhaps ar are looking in a longer term, don't expect to see a united Ireland in the short term. They would be quite happy with the north south cross border bodies which will have some powers, obviously, and an an overview of the situation within the island of Ireland. So that may be enough to keep most people on board. Certainly the reaction I have been getting uh just talking to the various parties is that there are ele elements in this that they like, there are others they're not so happy with, but really at the end of the day I think now people are going to have to face some unpalatable, hard facts about how northern Ireland's future is going to be mapped out and that's what they're going to have to address in the coming weeks and months. Is this document, released today by the British and Irish Governments, does it look like it is the basis for an agreement? Well, certainly th the Irish government have described it as a road map, um uh a way forward for people. uh th uh the British government have described it, say it's not set in tablets of stone but it is a way where we can progress these talks because most pa parties' complaint here has been that they're not really addressing the core issues and haven't been since the talks started in September. But neither are getting down to the core issues. Whether agreement can be reached, let's be honest about it. This is a a been a problem that's been running now for not only thirty years of violence in northern Ireland but certainly for the last seventy years, so it's going to be a very difficult problem to resolve. But I think what the governments are hoping for is that th if there is the good will and the desire and the willingness to compromise on all sides, then, yes, there is a basis for agreement and for a solution to the problems that uh b bedeviled this province for, for so many years.

 Former savings and loan chief, Charles ^Keating, is facing more legal troubles in California. A federal appeals court has reinstated his state convictions for securities fraud. _N_P_R's Elaine ^Corey has more from San Francisco. In nineteen ninetyone Charles ^Keating was convicted in state court of helping to defraud thousands of investors who bought high risk junk bonds sold by ^Keating's employees at Lincoln savings and loan. The bonds became worthless when the bankrupt thrift was seized by government regulators. ^Keating's convictions were thrown out in nineteen ninetysix on a technicality. And on that basis ^Keating was released from prison before he was eligible for parole. Now the ninth _U_S circuit court of appeals has ruled that the original appeal was flawed since it brought up issues that had not been raised before. That means the convictions stand, a ruling likely to send ^Keating's lawyers back to state court where they must start over with a new appeal. Elaine ^Corey, _N_P_R news, San Francisco.

 Now for today's geography quiz. We're off in search of an ancient and exotic city. An officially sanctioned one, too. UNESCO declared it a protected site for its beauty and its historical significance. The city could have used some special protection in nineteen seventynine when the Soviet Union invaded ^Afghanistan. Most of the city's monuments were destroyed, including a magnificent tiled mosque, which dominated the skyline for centuries. The people here are famous throughout central Asia for their skill in fashioning pottery and tile, glass too. Some families have kept their glass working secrets for more than two thousand years. Even though this city is in ^Afghanistan, most people here speak a dialect of the ^Persian language, and have long standing cultural ties with neighboring Iran. Think you got it? Well, frankly, I don't, but the answer is coming up in just a few minutes.

 Compared to the Washington media frenzy, the international reaction to the White House sex scandal is down right sober. One foreign correspondent explains how the president may just weather the storm. Clinton haters have +always been saying this guy is bad news, and American publics have been saying, so what?
---------------------------
 A Washington grand jury opened its investigation today into the latest allegations involving the president and former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. And the panel called President Clinton's personal secretary, Betty ^Currie. ^Currie is reported to have authorized Lewinsky to return to the White House a number of times after the former intern had moved to a job at the pentagon. During that time, Lewinsky reportedly also sent several packages addressed to ^Currie at the White House. ^Currie declined to comment as she left the proceeding.

 Speaking of other kinds of homes, Parisians have a problem that's familiar to any number of American cities, too many dog droppings. The city of light is trying to lighten the load by implementing privies, where animals can legally seek relief. The areas on sidewalks and some fenced off street spaces are marked by wooden stakes and surrounded by plants, and will be washed four or five times a day as part of an ongoing experiment. Yet another cutting edge development by the French in their ongoing dealings with their enormous pet population.

 The _U_S is bolstering its military presence in the gulf, as President Clinton discussed the Iraq crisis with the one ally who has backed his threat of force, British prime minister Tony Blair. The World's Nancy Marshall reports on Mr. Blair's current visit to Washington and the special relationship between the two leaders. President Clinton rolled out the red carpet for prime minister Blair, welcoming him not only as a close ally, but a close friend. Posing for photographers with Clinton, Blair pledged to stand united with the president against Iraq, warning Saddam Hussein that the threat of force is real. The British aircraft carrier invincible is now patrolling the Persian Gulf alongside three _U_S vessels. Washington and London are virtually alone in warning Iraq of military strikes if it doesn't back down on the weapons inspection issue. President Clinton says he and Blair will stand together not just on Iraq but also on arresting the terrorists suspected of blowing up Pan Am flight one oh three over Scotland. For The World I'm Nancy Marshall in Washington.

 Thousands of people in Germany have been demonstrating today against the high level of unemployment in the country. Latest figures show a sharp rise, with nearly five million Germans out of work. Caroline ^Wyatt reports. Chanting Helmut ^Kohl must go the unemployed took to the streets of the German capital, Berlin, mirroring protests around the country. Joblessness is now at its highest level in Germany since the second world war. With the general election due this September, record figures couldn't have come at a worst time for Chancellor ^Kohl. His promise to half unemployment by the year two thousand has now been abandoned. And the German electorate appears increasingly eager to dispense with the services of Europe's longest serving leader. Caroline ^Wyatt, _B_B_C news, ^Bonn.

 Well, in an unrelated development with an unrelated species, an unnamed rat managed to ground a Swiss Air passenger plane at Zurich airport for two days. The plane had been scheduled to fly to Vienna, home of the schnitzel, when a crew member spotted the alleged stowaway onboard. Passengers were moved to another plane and after a two day hunt the furry little gourmand was found, dead, in a trap baited with bacon. No comment on whether he had managed to enjoy any of the inflight snacks.

 Officials in California are warning residents that oncoming rains will cause dangerous and unpredictable landslides. From member station _K_Q_E_D, ^Auncil ^Martinez reports. Experts say the ground is so saturated it cannot absorb any more water. So that means soil will fall off in chunks and destroy anything in its path. In Los Angeles that lesson was brought home today when tons of earth cascaded down a hillside, ripping two houses from their foundations. No one was hurt, but firefighters ordered the evacuation of nearby homes and said they'll monitor the shifting ground. In the northern California town of Rio ^Nido, officials say a football field sized slab of hillside could still break loose at any time and destroy an entire neighborhood. And in San Francisco, a mansion overlooking the Pacific Ocean and the Golden Gate Bridge is slipping toward the sea. Forecasters say the picture will get worse because more rains are on the way. For _N_P_R news, I'm ^Auncil ^Martinez reporting.

 For the world, this is Pamela ^McCall in the _B_B_C news room in London. The United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan has confirmed that he is sending a two man technical team to Iraq to establish the location and extent of eight sites from which _U_N weapons inspectors have been denied access. The BBC's _U_N's correspondent says diplomats are puzzled by the move, which was strongly criticized by the _U_S and Britain when Mr. Annan first floated the idea on Wednesday. Russia has presented a new proposal to the _U_N security council to try to end the deadlock, but President Clinton has made it clear that differences with Russia would not prevent Washington taking military action if necessary. I am still working with the uh Russians, the French, the United Nations, anybody to try to find a diplomatic solution. The difference here is that I simply do not believe it is acceptable to permit Iraq to walk away from its obligations. uh We don't believe it is an i acceptable if diplomacy fails to walk away. President Clinton.

 The British government has formally called for Sinn Fein, the _I_R_A's political wing, to be expelled from the multiparty peace talks on northern Ireland. The move had been widely expected after northern Ireland police said they believe the _I_R_A was behind two killings in Belfast last week. Sinn Fein chairman ^Mitchell ^McLaughlin says the party will challenge the move by legal means if they have to. We're going to fight it. And uh we've already challenged, very strongly, the uh the terms in which this has been presented. But we're challenging it on the ground that uh the _R_U_C uh have offered an opinion, and this opinion is going to be used as a mechanism for ejecting us from the talks, and uh that's a very serious . Any decision to expel Sinn Fein must be agreed jointly by the governments of both Britain and the Irish Republic.

 Time to sift through our listener mail bag for your comments. Who cares? That seems to be the overwhelming sentiment to the Clinton sex scandal. ^Bradley ^Berg from Corvallis, Oregon writes, even if these allegations were true, how would the affair rank among the issues vexing the government, remembering your recent piece on European reaction to the attention given to the scandals in the United States, I have no doubt that they truly must be laughing at us now. President Clinton is not the only one in trouble.

 And finally, first clap skates, and now this. Apparently a New Yorkbased scientist has come up with a daring new accessory for cyclists, wings. Inventor Robert ^Saben concerned with the fact that cyclists are such a drag on their bicycles has created an outfit that's supposed to make man and machine function more as one. ^Saben's fanciful creation is a tunic that clings tightly to the rider's stomach and acts as a support for two triangular wings that extend out from the shoulder blades.

 This is The World. I'm Eddie Mair in London. And I'm Lisa Mullins in Boston. As Kofi Annan prepares for his lastditch try for a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi crisis, he's getting good wishes and warnings from _U_S officials. The _U_N secretary general departs this weekend for Baghdad to meet with Iraq's president Saddam Hussein. A White House spokesman says there's been no indication from Iraq that would lead anyone to be optimistic about the trip, but, he continued, it is important to make this effort. Even Annan admits he has a difficult mission. _U_S and British officials have cautioned that they won't accept any settlement short of complete, unfettered access to all suspected weapons sites in Iraq. Joseph Nye, dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, puts the secretary general's chance of success at less than even. But he does envision a scenario for a short term diplomatic solution. It's conceivable that if Saddam believes that the punishment that he would a absorb from the military strike can be avoided and that he can reap the gains of diplomatic support and domestic support while avoiding the punishment, he just might feel that it's worth acceding to what Kofi Annan would ah put forward and then uh play the whole game again in six months or a year from now. Do you think Kofi Annan is going to have to offer him something? I think Kofi Annan has to he may be able to offer him some cosmetic things like adding additional groups or or nations to the inspector teams and so forth, but he can't, I believe, accept uh Saddam's desire to exclude large areas as he now uh is excluding from inspection or to have what you might call rigged inspections in which you have teams without technical skills. So I think those are going to be the parameters within which he has to work. All of this comes as the _U_N announces it's pulling out humanitarian personnel from Baghdad. It sounds like they're preparing for a strike, doesn't it? Well, I think as I said, I think the chances are are better that even that Saddam will not cave in at the last minute and that there would be a strike. But uh it's certainly important for Kofi Annan to go to Baghdad and see if he can get the _U_N inspections back in because that's probably the uh one of the best ways to keep Saddam's weapons of mass destruction programs under control. And if we have a strike and lose the inspection system, we're not the better off for it, we're the worse off for it. How do you rate Kofi Annan as a negotiator? I think uh Kofi Annan is a extremely skillful negotiator. I think he's been an excellent uh secretary general. I think what he's doing now is what a secretary general should do, but he's got a very narrow window to work in. Will he have enough respect in Baghdad, or will they see him as an American puppet? Well, I think they're, they have to uh see him as the, the best interlocutor they're going to get. He has to, obviously, steer his way through a security council where there're some divisions among the major powers, and uh they will hope that they can play on that uh division. But uh Kofi Annan has at the same time to realize that if he loses support of any of the five major powers, his mission will not have been successful. So Baghdad'll try to put Kofi Annan in an awkward situation, and, and Kofi is going to have to see whether he can negotiate something in the narrow constraints that would meet approval of the security council. Thank you for joining us on The World. You're very welcome. Joseph Nye, dean of Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, and former assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs.

 This is the world. I'm Eddie ^Mair. And I'm Lisa Mullins. One hundred fifty years ago today, a document was published that was to change the political face of the world. The Communist Manifesto, written by Karl Marx and ^Friedrich Engels, inspired revolutions across the globe. Lenin read it. So did Mao ^Tsetung and Ho Chi ^Minh. At one stage, a third of the world's population lived under communist governments. But now the great Marxist experiment appears to be in ruins. The collapse of the Soviet Union brought down a host of communist regimes, and few nations these days aspire to anything other than a thriving capitalist economy. But Marxism is not dead. To discuss how the ideas of the Communist Manifesto are interpreted these days, we turn to Alexei ^Pushkoff, political columnist with The Independent in Moscow, and Richard ^Sakwa, professor of Russian politics at Kent University here in Britain. According to ^Sakwa, the Communist Manifesto still communicates revolutionary fervor. It's a phenomenally powerful message Marx is putting forwards, the idea that the last revolutionary class will put an end to exploitation entirely, and it's this vision of human emancipation ultimately which is more important than even his ideas about political economy and all the other things. But yet, despite his enormous faults, he still had this message of human emancipation, and it's this which gave Marx and Marxism its power over the years. What is the central message of the Manifesto? Most people can quote a line or two from it, but if you were to identify the central thrust, what is it? The opening lines of the Communist Manifesto, which talks about the emergence of communism as a organized force, the history of all the hitherto existing societies, he says, is the history of class +struggles, and so on. The idea of huge capital, all you have to do, Marx would say, is to get rid of a few capitalists and then people could take over and manage their lives themselves. Alexei ^Pushkoff, w when you look at marxism in practice, you look at China branching out now as a free market economy, you look at Cuba, looking for outside investors, and of course the collapse of the Soviet Union. Should we conclude that marxism has failed? Well, I think marxism has definitely failed as a political experiment and as a social experiment, but marxism has not failed as a social theory and uh as a a way of thinking because marxism, to my mind, if we take th the general mythology of marxism, which is much more primitive than his theories, w what it basically says is that the capitalist society is not just, that there should be a better society, and that there are certain ways by which the capitalist society can be changed into a better society. I think this idea is still very popular not only in the third world but also e even in Western European countries. So I think that Marx has not failed as a way of thinking, as a theory which pictures the alternative to the existing society, with which many people will always be unhappy. And in this way, I think we will carry Marx with us well into the twentyfirst century. The New Yorker Magazine recently pronounced the world's next big thinker to be Karl Marx. They argue that he was way ahead in his views on globalization, that he predicted that economics and not politics would be the driving force in the future. Was Marx just a man ahead of his time, Alexei ^Pushkoff? Well, I think that Marx was both very much rooted in his time, and of course he was a visionary at the same time. I think th this very combination makes his message so strong. I guess h he was actually looking into the future, which was supposed to be very far ahead. I would say over th the uh experience which Russia, for instance, had. He was looking in the twentysecond century. You know, he was bypassing all such small details for him as the practical organization of a, of a communist society. We have experienced this practical organization, we know what it is, we know that uh bureaucracy has become the main driving force uh of the society, w we know that terror has uh become one of the main instruments of controlling the people, but when it comes to realities, I think that Marx was uh much more wrong than right. He never understood uh that even when economic forces dominate the general flow of human development, there is still place for an individual, there is still place for civil rights, there is still place for a personality. Richard ^Sakwa, is it possible that perhaps in a hundred and fifty years' time, maybe sooner, uh my successor will be sitting asking your successor about what an enormous success Marx has been in practice? I I doubt it very much. It's a good question. I wonder though, sometimes, whether in a hundred and fifty or two hundred years, whether, when the question is asked, they'd say, Marx, who was he? Some, perhaps not a utopian thinker, certainly an important social thinker of the mid nineteenth century whose ideas were taken up in uh certain +peripheral countries, the third world, uh Russia, uh eastern +Europe, in a different way, China, but he forgot the politics, he forgot that people are involved in it, so, quite clearly, it doesn't have much to say about the relationship between the markets and politics. He tended to reduce politics to economics, and that was quite false. Thank you both for helping us mark the anniversary. Richard ^Sakwa, professor of Russian and European politics at Kent University in England, and Alexei ^Pushkoff, political columnist at The Independent newspaper in Moscow. Many thanks to you both.

 Tomorrow the board of supervisors of ^Loudon county, Virginia, will vote on whether a school now located in Mount Vernon can relocate to their county. In some respects, that's typical county business, but tomorrow's vote has international implications. The board will decide whether the Islamic Saudi Academy, funded by the government of Saudi Arabia, can move to ^Ashburn village, Virginia. But local residents have not exactly laid out the red carpet for their would be neighbors. The World's Nancy Marshalll has our story. Inside the Islamic Saudi academy in Mount Vernon, Virginia, many of the girls wear head scarves and some of the neatly dressed children are in uniforms. The instruction is in English for most classes, in Arabic for language and religious studies. The school says it teaches the children to be good Muslims and good students. They're learning a civics lesson from the residents of ^Loudon county. The Islamic Saudi Academy has twelve hundred mostly American students but would take thirtyfive hundred if it had the room. The academy bought a hundred acres in ^Loudon county, Virginia, and asked for permission to build a fifty million dollar campus. In the nearby suburban housing tracts, someone dropped off leaflets warning the school could bring thousands of Middle Eastern strangers and terrorists. Some residents of the mostly white, mostly middle class area became alarmed. James ^Zogby of the Arab American Institute says it's a familiar story. There is, a at a very deep level in our culture, um I think, a sense of, of ignorance about Islam, a fear about who Muslims are and what they're doing. Many local residents denounced the bigotry, but opposition to the school then shifted. Now critics of the academy are targeting its owner, the Saudi government. Pastor James ^Allmen of the fellowship church and school in ^Ashburn has led the antiSaudi campaign. James ^Allmen says he has no problem with a privately funded academy, but he has a big problem with a Saudi funded school. The Saudi Arabian government has an atrocious record on human rights and is known to be one of the worst offending countries when it comes to religious persecution. That's correct. And that is a condition of the application, then. That is a condition of At a public hearing on the Islamic Saudi Academy's application, the split in county opinion was obvious, supporters of the academy, including ^Ann Robinson, said the Saudis were just providing a service and it was unfair to penalize children. We do not further the purpose of human rights in the world by violating the human rights under our own constitution. But opponents said the school might be a target for terrorist attacks, complained about its tax exempt status, and wondered why the Saudis are not compelled to allow Christians to worship in their country. Virginia ^Welch delivered this message to the county board of supervisors. I urge you to do the right thing and send a message to the Saudis that the citizens of ^Loudon county embrace religious and human freedom. ^Loudon county officials say they'll rule on the application based only on land use issues and ignore all the other objections. What's really behind those objections, some say, is ^Loudon county's collision with a new reality in America that the country is changing religiously as surely as it is racially and ethnically. According to the Arab American institute, Islam will one day be the second largest religion in the country. For an indication of the problems that could face Muslims as they integrate into American life, one need look no farther than ^Loudon county, Virginia. For The World, I'm Nancy Marshalll.

 For The World, this is Pamela ^McCall in the _B_B_C news room in London. More heavy gunfire in the Serbian province of Kosovo. It's the second day of an offensive by the security forces against villages populated by ethnic Albanians. _B_B_C correspondent ^Karyn ^Coleman reports from Kosovo. There were more accounts of people fleeing from the villages near where the offensive was taking place. They were too afraid to stay, fearing the forces may also move their operations further afield. By mid afternoon, official Serb sources were saying the operation was over, but that has not yet been confirmed from Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, which is where the whole attack is thought to have been planned. The ethnic Albanians here in Kosovo are considerably worried about the future and fear they are witnessing the beginnings of a much wider conflict. ^Karyn ^Coleman, _B_B_C news, ^Pristina.

 Bureaucrats aren't the only Chinese with something to fear from a slimmed down central government. China's elderly have seen their support systems wither on the vine in recent years. As Rob ^Gifford reports, it's been a difficult adjustment in a culture that for centuries has revered its elders. Most days, especially when the northerly wind is not too cold to bear, parks and open spaces in Beijing fill up with people dancing, exercising, or doing tai chi. Move a little closer and you'll see that many of the dancers have gray hair. Here is a slice of China's elderly population, a rapidly growing group in Chinese society, according to population expert ^Chu ^Li of the Chinese academy of social sciences. The key feature of China's aging population is its very fast growth rate, especially compared to western countries. The major problem with this is that China's current pension and social security system is only just being established. In western countries, the population has aged gradually after the pension and social security systems have been completed. In other words, China is having to do in twenty years what western countries achieved in sixty. Caged song birds liven up the gray interior of the ^Song ^Tang hospice in southeast Beijing. ^Song ^Tang is still China's only official hospice. The communist system used to provide cradle to grave care for its citizens within what was known as the work unit, but as China has opened up and fewer people are now obliged to remain within their work unit, so the elderly can now not always rely on that safety net. And even when they do, some find the modern attitudes of the young do not measure up to the standards of traditional Chinese filial piety. ^Lu ^Yuen ^Lin, a ninetytwo year old former nurse, came here to ^Song ^Tang after a fall at her home and has since refused to leave. My family lives on the fifteenth floor. It's too high. I used to get so lonesome when everyone was away at work. And anyway, people think the elderly are annoying and troublesome and think up ways to get out of looking after them. My daughterinlaw actually said, why should I take up such a burden? I can't cope with it. Mrs. ^Lu's mind is still sharp, and she keeps her old friends amused with some tricky tongue twisters. Despite her good humor, Mrs. ^Lu is pained by the recent changes she has observed in China. She blames the chaos of the cultural revolution, the period between nineteen sixtysix and seventysix when chairman Mao encouraged youngsters to rise up in rebellion against their elders. Population expert ^Chu ^Li sees another problem. Before young people had more free time staying at home or whatever, but now they have more pressure at work and the pace of life is so much faster than before. Also, their jobs are not so secure. You have to make the choice between your work and your parents because you run the risk of being fired if you're trying to look after someone totally by yourself. The recently passed elderly rights protection law is the first of its kind in China to acknowledge the breakdown of traditional values. Its statutes attempt to reinstitute Confucian respect for the elderly by making neglect or abuse of old people a crime. The law also tries to make families responsible for looking after elderly parents or at least to share responsibility with former employers and the government. But it will take more than a law to stop the tide of social change. As the dancing grannies in Beijing's parks attest, China is getting old before it gets rich. By the year twenty twenty, one out of every four senior citizens in the world will be Chinese. For millennia, respect for the elderly has been a pillar of Chinese society, but now modern China is discovering that some of the heaviest costs of progress are being born by the nation's senior citizens. For The World, this is Rob ^Gifford.

 And how about this? An inmate who makes fiftyfour thousand dollars a year? ^Graham ^Edson, in jail in Britain on fraud charges, is apparently raking it in. Every day, ^Edson's let out of prison to work at a nearby ad agency. While ^Edson maybe a happy jail bird, his jailers are not so pleased. They've expressed outrage over the fact that the convict earns three times as much as they do.

 A visit by British foreign secretary Robin Cook to the proposed site of an Israeli settlement in Jerusalem has drawn a harsh reaction from Israeli officials. More from the _B_B_C's Barnaby Mason in Jerusalem. , the British foreign secretary was jostled by Israeli demonstrators shouting Robin Cook go home, and accusing him of antisemitism. Despite this he succeeded in meeting local Palestinian representatives at the site. That provoked a formal protest from the Israeli government which regards the area as permanent Israeli territory. Mr. Netanyahu then canceled the dinner he was to have held with Mr. Cook, a notable snub not only to Britain but to the European Union, on whose behalf the foreign secretary is making his Middle East tour. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the affair is the outspoken remarks made by British officials who preferred not to be identified. They described the cancellation of the dinner as a fantastic overreaction, asking whether a hand shake could be so dangerous. The _B_B_C's Barnaby Mason in Jerusalem.

 This is the world in Boston. I'm Lisa Mullins. China's new premiere was greeted with thunderous applause today in Beijing's great hall of the people. ^Ju ^Rong ^Zhi actually had been selected months ago by the communist party leadership to overhaul China's crumbling state industry and its ailing banks. The man he replaces, ^Li ^Pung, was elected today to head the national legislature. ^Ju ^Rong ^Zhi becomes premiere as China's export fuel growth is stalling, a victim of the Asian financial crisis, but as the world's ^Alan Dow reports, ^Ju is as prepared as anyone to take the tough steps needed to recharge China's economy. As mayor of Shanghai ten years ago, ^Ju ^Rong ^Zhi turned the long neglected city into the emerging financial hub of China. In his most recent job as China's chief economist, ^Ju was the darling of Western captains of industry who are keen for a piece of the action in the world's largest captive market. Please don't come too quickly. If you come too quickly and if you can't make money because of that, please don't make complaint to me. Thank you. ^Ju ^Rong ^Zhi has a reputation for getting things done. In China, he's known as the boss. ^Ann Yeng of the _U_S China business council in Beijing says that's why he was chosen as China's new premiere. He personally follows up on on all of his policies and directives. He uses a meritocracy. He puts in place people who are uh capable and also respond and also he's willing to fire people, which is pretty unusual in China. And so people do respond when ^Ju ^Rong ^Zhi wants something. But ^Ju's new mandate will be as challenging as any he's faced so far. As premiere, his first big task will be to streamline China's bloated and corrupt bureaucracy. Three and a half million civil servants are to be laid off in the next year and many state enterprises will be auctioned off, merged or closed. There are many politicians who won't appreciate some of the cuts ^Ju is about to make but ^Ann ^Yeng says cut he must if China is to overcome its economic problems. The root cause really is state owned enterprise and the failure so far to reform state owned enterprise in a really significant way and therefore the failure to reform the state banking system which is uh completely intermingled with the state system. This requires a whole lot of political pain, and so it's a very, very frightening or bracing task, but ^Ju ^Rong ^Zhi has taken steps that show he's really serious about it. ^Ju may be serious about tackling the country's huge bureaucracy, but whether he will move the premier's office from the shadow of its most notorious moment in recent history isn't so clear. Ju's predecessor ^Li ^Pung became infamous as the man who ordered the tanks into Tiananmen Square. A fledging move towards democracy was crushed and both China and ^Li have faced the scorn of many westerners ever since. But China's economic reform under ^Li's premiership will undoubtedly be his swan song. Speaking to the people's congress recently, Lee thanked governments and companies around the world for what he called their sympathy and support for China's modernization. A modernization that ^Ju is suited to continue. According to professor ^Song ^Ko ^Ching of Beijing University. especially is the uh reform process, different people have different opinions so there needs to be someone who has some hard ch uh characters I mean here is a man who can get agreement from others. The number of _T_V commercials for consumer goods is evidence of how times have changed in China, change the country's new premiere seems ready to accelerate. For the The World, I'm ^Alan Dow.

 For today's geography quiz, were thinking tulips. But, no, were not in the Netherlands. In fact, were in the tulip capital of Japan. Located just an hour and a half away from Tokyo, if you travel by bullet train that is, the city is famous not only for its tulips but also for its ^Koshihi ^Kari rice grown around our mystery city and famed throughout Japan for its excellent flavor. This city is a major port and enjoys links with ports in nearby China, Russia, and South Korea. As a result, it's rapidly becoming an unofficial capital of the entire sea of Japan basin and traders and tourists flock here daily. Think this one over for a few minutes. The name of this tulip capital is on the way.

 Well, time now for today's geography quiz. Like President Clinton, we're in South Africa today. Unlike the President, we're not in Cape Town, but in a corner of the country that is forever French. In fact the name of our mystery destination, translated from ^Afrikaans, is French Corner. This wine producing village grew prosperous from the vines planted here by Protestant refugees from France three hundred years ago, but every sunlit spot must cast its shadow, no? So the French grew rich by using slaves to help them cultivate these vines. Think it over. We'll answer today's geography quiz in a few minutes.

 This is The World, a coproduction of the _B_B_C world service, _P_R_I and _W_G_B_H in Boston. I'm Lisa ^Mullins. In Mexico today, the government is closing the net on foreign nationals in ^Chiapas. It set up more military checkpoints in the southern state in an attempt to round up foreigners suspected of supporting the Zapatista rebels. Last week, the government expelled fifteen foreign nationals from ^Chiapas, accusing them of violating the Mexican constitution by engaging in political activity. The World's ^Alejandra ^Martins is now in San ^Cristobal De Las Casas in the heart of ^Chiapas. ^Alejandra, why is the Mexican government focusing on foreigners in ^Chiapas and trying to expel them? The government is saying very clearly that, uh, it's not xenophobic at all, that they are expelling the foreigners because they are violating the Mexican constitution by supporting the pro Zapatista communities. But, uh, they might have been, eh, to some foreigners who might have been engaging in some sort of illegal activities. But, uh, the truth is for the vast majority of the foreigners who I've seen in these communities are not engaging in any kind of activities at all. They are there just as observers. And the interesting thing is that the leaders of the pro Zapatista communities that I've talked to want them to be there, because they feel afraid that at some point, uh, the army might enter the communities, and they feel afraid of the paramilitaries as well. And they feel that by having foreigners there, it's a kind of, it's a guarantee. So you're saying that they look on the foreigners as a kind of protection, and in the event th that more and more foreigners are expelled, is it seen as the government's aim to try and intensify the campaign against the Zapatistas, uh, with the, with the, ultimate goal of destroying the group? This is certainly the feeling among some of the leaders of this pro Zapatista communities. It is difficult, really, to know at this point what the strategy uh of the government is. Uh, the President, President ^Zedillo, is saying that, uh, the government wants to negotiate, that they don't want a military solution to the conflict. But, on the other hand, it's difficult to see how negotiation can take place, because there is a complete lack of trust, uh, between both parts. Who are the foreigners who you're talking about there? I know that you said many are tourists and, and, uh, observers. The ones who seem to be supporting the Zapatistas, uh, who exactly are they? And are they primarily Americans? Not necessarily. I went to one of the communities, one of these pro Zapatista, uh, communities, uh, where they have, uh autonomous municipality that they've established, the ones that the government says are completely illegal. And I found there French, uh, nationals. I found there Italians. I found there lots of people from Spain. I didn't find anybody from the _U_S, but I did find people from the _U_S here in San ^Cristobal who were ready to travel to some of the communities. And, uh, the motivations are very, very, uh, different. In some cases, you have idealistic Europeans or Americans who want to come and, and learn, uh, from the communities how to live in a community, how to take decisions among the community. Other people are just concerned about the situation in ^Chiapas. Uh, they get all sorts of information in their countries, and they want to come and see what's going on. So is it your sense, ^Alejandra that the kind of crackdown that we've been seeing on, on foreign nationals in ^Chiapas that that sort of thing might continue? I think so. Uh, when I was traveling to one of these, uh, pro Zapatista communities, I was traveling in a van, and there was a French woman in the van. We were stopped at a military checkpoint. We stayed there for an hour. And uh even though she was not doing anything at all, uh, she was traveling on a tourist visa, but just the fact that she was entering a highly sensitive area was enough for the authorities to confiscate her tourist visa and ask her to report, uh, to the authorities within fortyeight hours. She has to report today, so we'll see what happens. But this indicates it's just, uh, entering this area is enough for the authorities to raise suspicion. The World's ^Alejandra ^Martins speaking to us from San ^Cristobal De Las Casas in ^Chiapas, Mexico. Thank you, ^Alejandra. Thank you, Lisa.

 Human rights groups are protesting Rwanda's plans to execute more than twenty people involved in the nineteen ninetyfour genocide. Amnesty International says the executions scheduled for Friday will not serve the interests of justice and will further brutalize Rwandan society. Jose ^Luis ^Herrero of the _U_N commission on human rights in Rwanda agrees. The _U_N discourages application of the death penalty, and in that sense, this new development that confirms the intention of the government of Rwanda to carry out the executions is not seen positively. But at the end of the day, it's a sovereign decision of the Rwandan government. Rwanda says the executions will show people the judicial process really is working. The authorities say justice must be seen to be done.

Right now what we do know is that President ^Milosevic has sent his uh military forces into Kosovo, that uh they are operating along the borders between uh Kosovo and Albania, that this is an extremely grave situation where uh the Serbian military is being used to try to solve a problem that cannot be solved on the battlefield. James Rubin. Serbia has rejected calls for international mediation.

 Time now for our geography quiz today. We're traveling down the Volga river to a city that, like many Russian cities, has had several names. But this one stands out as the scene of an epic battle in world war two in which the Nazis were annihilated. Its streets are still filled with huge, and some would say ugly, memorials to the action. This place had a special significance at that time. It carried the name of a communist dictator. Two decades earlier it was called ^Tsaritsyn. And two decades later, it changed its name again. That's the answer we're looking for, the current name of this historic Russian city on the banks of the Volga river. We'll solve today's puzzler in just a few minutes.
---------------------------
 Another chapter of history that began during world war two is also being written today. A Japanese court this morning ruled that Tokyo should compensate three South Korean women who were forced to provide sex to Japanese soldiers during the war. The sum is small, a little over two thousand dollars, to each of the women. But the symbolism is enormous. Up to now, the Japanese government has refused to pay direct compensation to the socalled comfort women. Instead setting up a private fund to offer reparations. But today the judge ruled that Tokyo had neglected its legal duty to repair the comfort women's anguish. The _B_B_C's Juliette ^Hindle is in Tokyo. Juliette, on the one hand today's decision has been hailed as a precedent. On the other, it's being condemned by some women's groups. Why is that? Well it is a breakthrough in many senses because up until now as you mentioned, the Tokyo courts have always ruled in favor of the government. But it now appears that they are truly independent and there had been some doubts about that. But the reason why it's also being regarded as dissatisfactory is that it's a very paltry sum involved, much less than the women were actually asking for. But also it's slightly reluctantly given in some senses. And the government has um already said that it's likely to appeal and that it's very disappointed with the court result. An and the amount we're talking about is two thousand two hundred seventytwo dollars. uh th the Japanese government has admitted that these women were forced into sexual slavery. But it has always avoided paying any kind of compensation. What's the reasoning behind their refusal? The whole issue of Japan's war past is incredibly sensitive and very difficult for politicians here to deal with. On the one hand, there's a growing body of people who think Japan should face up to its past. But there's still a very influential group of people who believe that Japan acted in a completely justifiable way given that uh it was a time of war. So it's not a simple issue here. But there are plenty of people who do think the government is acting in a very anachronistic way. Maybe that would also shed some light on the issue of the apology. Cou could you explain Japan's reluctance to formally apologize for forcing these people to act as comfort women? What is behind that? Well, for many years Japan didn't admit to the existence of these wartime brothels where women were forced into prostitution for the pleasure of Japanese military. um It was not until nineteen ninetythree that the government officially said some of these women had been forced against their will to work in these places. So, it's taken that long to get through that barrier of shame or discomfort with atrocities that happened in the past. I wonder if also there's an issue of of th the weight of public apology and how it's viewed in Japan as opposed to someplace like here in America. I think there is a very different attitude to what happened in the past. And, of course, many people here still have relatives, grandfathers, uncles and so on who took part in these atrocities. So if the whole nation then turns around and apologizes for what those elders did, um they're really saying that those people ar are not fit to be part of their society. And it's very difficult for Japan to reject this whole group. I think it would take a at least another generation for Japan to get over its complex about what happened in the war. And some of the women who were forced to work in brothels, they are much older now as well, seventynine, eighty years old in some cases, but they seem vehement about the issue of restitution. What what does it seem uh that they want? What they're really campaigning for is a dignified apology so that their suffering is not forgotten. So that they are honored for the, the awful things that they had to undergo in a situation that nobody hopes will be repeated. And some of them are speaking out now about the compensation that has been offered. And apparently women's groups are working to pass a law that would set the stage for paying compensation to all uh th the comfort women. Yes. As many as two hundred thousand women across Asia were forced into prostitution. Nobody's really sure how many of those are still alive. And as the years go by, it obviously becomes a smaller number. I think really Japan needs to act soon to be able to assuage this guilt. Because soon the people who can talk about what happened won't be around anymore. With that kind of pressure, do you think that these women will uh ever get a formal apology from the government? I think it's very unlikely that they will see a national government of Japan stand up and apologize for everything that took place in the second world war. Just think, over the last fiftythree years, they've managed to avoid doing that. There've been various different prime ministers with various different political backgrounds and they've all avoided doing it. They offer half way apologies and individual apologies. But a national apology, I don't think we'll see it in the lifetime of most of the comfort women. The _B_B_C's Juliette ^Hindle speaking to us from Tokyo. Thanks very much. Thank you.

 Nigerian security forces clashed in ^Lagos with antigovernment demonstrators who were protesting calls for military leader ^Sani ^Abacha to run for president. Meanwhile, as _V_O_A West Africa Correspondent ^Purnell ^Murdock reports, General ^Abacha's supporters began a two day rally in the capital, ^Abuja, to urge him to compete in this year's election. Nigeria state radio says thousands of people began gathering in the capital ^Abuja early Tuesday for the two day rally supporting General ^Sani ^Abacha's candidacy. Organizers state the two days of music, dancing, and speeches is expected to draw some two million people. But as supporters of the military leader gathered in the north, riot police deployed in Nigeria's southern commercial capital ^Lagos, to break up a protest rally called by the political opposition. Although General ^Abacha had not publicly announced his candidacy, many people believe an ^Abacha presidency is a foregone conclusion. Some analysts say the outcome of a face off between the police and anti ^Abacha political groups will be a test of the opposition's resolve. ^Purnell ^Murdock, _V_O_A News.

 Russian President Boris ^Yeltsin has appointed a civilian as Security Council Chief and given him additional powers to streamline reforms in Russia's ailing military. In his new capacity, Andre ^Capotian will oversee the Defense Council and Military Inspectorate which have been merged into the Security Council. President ^Yeltsin has made military reform a priority and given Mr. ^Capotian one month to submit his proposals to slash troop numbers and increase combat readiness. Mr. ^Capotian replaces Ivan ^Ripkin, a loyal Kremlin supporter, who was put in charge of relations with former Soviet republics. The changes are part of a minor shakeup of Mr. Yeltsin's cabinet aimed at making the government more efficient.

 While the expansion of the Internet has been a blessing for researchers, students and the just plain curious, the new opportunities mentioned by Mr. Gates are also being used by some rather unsavory characters. A new report says there has been a dramatic rise in the growth of hate groups in the United States over the past year. And many of them are using the Internet to spread their messages of racial superiority. _V_O_A's Jim ^Teple has details from our southeast news bureau. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights monitoring group based in Montgomery, Alabama, has long monitored such groups as the ^Ku Klux Klan. More recently it has followed the growth of the militia movement and church groups that preach a message of white supremacy and antisemitism. The new study written by Mark ^Potach, who edits the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Report, warns that such groups grew rapidly last year, mostly by recruiting younger members. Mr. ^Potach says the growth is surprising since membership in hate groups usually declines during periods of economic prosperity. We in fact have seen hate group numbers dropping through the nineties, uh but this year they jumped up uh twenty percent, quite a dramatic rise. Mark ^Potach says over four hundred hate groups have been identified and many are becoming increasingly successful at recruiting younger members through the use of Internet web pages and the promotion of racist rock music. The Internet has certainly helped uh hate mongers to organize and uh to feel that they are part of a larger community, even if uh they are essentially uh, you know, angry people sitting in their bedrooms uh all alone. Uh, in addition, white power racist music has become uh quite popular in certain sectors. Uh, there are over fifty thousand _C_D_s a year sold with uh lyrics that are quite uh unbelievable. Many of these new members are joining chapters of the so called Christian Identity Movement which cites Biblical scripture as a foundation for a belief in white supremacy and antisemitism. Mark ^Potach says such members are also intensely attracted to apocalyptical fantasies. The approach of the year two thousand has many of these groups in a kind of millennial frenzy. Uh, uh a they believe, or at least many of them believe, uh that they are approaching the Battle of Armageddon in which they will be pitted against the uh kind of Satanic forces trying to take over the world. Mr. ^Potach notes older, more traditional groups like the ^Ku Klux Klan are also opening new chapters, thanks in part to their ability to use new technologies like the Internet. The Federal Bureau of Investigation says it received more than eight thousand reports of hate group crimes last year. Law enforcement authorities say such reports are likely to increase as police departments are now beginning to more accurately report hate crimes than they have in the past.

 An American classical violin virtuoso with a zest for performing all kinds of music recently released a new recording of popular tunes. _V_O_A's Martin ^Bush in New York has her story. Nadia ^Solerno ^Sonnenberg is an energetic violin soloist. As one critic puts it, she's a risk taker on the concert stage and in life. Last year, she would not allow a water skiing accident to stop her from performing at concerts. The violinist also enjoys deep sea fishing. Mounted on the wall of her New York City apartment is a one hundred thirtysix kilogram blue shark she caught after an exhausting three hour struggle. Now, in concert and recording, Ms. ^Solerno ^Sonnenberg, born in Rome, Italy, is venturing into a field seldom even approached by her fellow violinists, popular music. The reason why is simple. I feel like doing it. I'm not going crossover. There is just, I mean, I will never, ever leave my roots. Uh, there's just a desire to do other things. And, uh, a very strong calling for it. And I am doing them now and having a fantastic time. What, what happens, ironically, and I don't think it's any great surprise, is when you go and play Brazilian music with phenomenal Brazilian guitarists and you go and play, uh, Cole Porter songs, great arrangements, with Broadway stars, and then you come back and play ^Tchaikovsky Concerto, you think of the ^Tchaikovsky in a different way. It is a new, fresh piece, regardless of how many times you've played it. Nadia ^Solerno ^Sonnenberg's latest undertaking in popular music is a new recording called ^Humoresque. She performs ten selections on the recording that were all on the soundtrack of a nineteen fortyseven film of the same title. ^Humoresque is a weepy tale about an affair between a struggling, talented young violinist and his sponsor, a rich, middle aged alcoholic woman. At the climax of the movie, the woman drowns herself, having been rejected by the violinist. As that occurs, the soundtrack sweeps up with the love death, segment, from ^Richard ^Wagner's music drama ^Tristan und Isolde. For Nadia ^Solerno ^Sonnenberg, playing that arrangement was a challenge. What's fantastic about it is that a violinist does not get to play solo ^Wagner ever. There is nothing written for violin by ^Wagner unless your sitting in the fiddle section. And I did when I was young, when I was a student, and I certainly got the feel of what it's like to play ^Wagner and the power of ^Wagner. But as a soloist, uh, playing, uh, wh what a singer wo would normally be singing was phenomenal experience. One of the selections from the fortyone year old film, ^Humoresque, is a tune by George ^Gershwin. I grew up listening to songs like that. My family, you know, wh what is played in the, in the household when you grow up is what, eh, makes an impression on you. That, so since I was a kid, I knew Embraceable You. Whatever the thirtyseven year old Nadia ^Solerno ^Sonnenberg performs, she has even made a rock and roll video, her involvement with the music is total. A music critic describes her as an intensely physical player who sways and stomps and grimaces and even cries in the grip of her music making. Another reviewer praises her for a tendency to treat every musical phrase as though she just discovered the deep meaning. Four years ago, the violinist accidently nearly sliced through the small finger on her left hand. A delicate operation restored the finger to full use, but it was a close call. These days, as the Washington Post notes, Nadia ^Solerno ^Sonnenberg is playing with the dedication of someone who has been given a second chance. This is Martin ^Bush, _V_O_A News, New York.

 International Women's Day is this coming Sunday, March eighth. A major focus of International Women's Day is the plight of Afghan women. Special events are being organized by the European Commission and individual nations in Europe, North America, and other parts of the world. Lisa ^Schlein reports from Geneva. Afghanistan has been at war for twenty years, leaving a large part of the country's male population dead or in exile. The United Nations says women and children make up about seventyfive percent of the Afghan population. An Afghan refugee in Switzerland, ^Homira ^Atimadi, is a senior official of a group called the International Working Group on Afghan Women. The group has branches in Pakistan, Iran, Europe, Australia, and North America. Ms. ^Atimadi says Afghan women have been victims of severe violations of human rights for the past twenty years and she says she sees no end to the misery. She says security under the fundamentalist Taleban government is better, but everything else is worse. Women do not become victims of armed attack, but they do not have the right to work. And today, the right to work is equal to r the right to survival. Ms. Atimadi says the war has created a nation of widows. Women have become the sole support of their families. Yet, the Taliban have forbidden them to work. She says this puts the very existence of women's families at risk. She says the plight of women in urban areas is greater than that which exists in rural parts of the country. In cities, such as the capital ^Kabul, women are totally dependent on international aid for survival. Ms. ^Atimadi says the women of ^Kabul symbolize the suffering of all the women in Afghanistan. The aim is to bring in not only the focus on women's right to education, access to work, but look beyond that and look at the roots of, uh of these problems. These are only the symptoms of the problems that are facing Afghanistan. For women in Afghanistan to be able to realize their rights, there have to be conditions of peace and justice. Ms. ^Atimadi says that is the primary focus of her group, peace and justice. She says her group is appealing to individuals, to the international community, and to the combatants and people of Afghanistan to stop the bloodletting which has torn the country apart.

 South Korea's government says it has achieved success in efforts to reschedule twenty four billion dollars in short term foreign debt. A finance ministry official told reporters in Seoul Monday that almost ninety percent of the country's international lenders have agreed to delay collection of their loans. Last month, South Korean officials began visiting creditors in several cities, including New York, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong, seeking agreements to reschedule.

 On yesterday's edition of our program, we told you about a report on hunger in the United States, a report issued by the largest charitable hunger relief organization in the country. What their survey of food banks found was that although the economy is booming, the number of Americans who need emergency food is staying constant and that many people who need it are people who have jobs and who are living in the suburbs. Correspondent Michael ^Leland reports that people who run food banks and shelters in the city of Chicago say the report findings came as no surprise to them. Ah, they need help so I came down At the Pacific Garden Mission in downtown Chicago, kitchen workers prepare the midday meal for a few hundred people, while food services director ^Floyd ^Turnbill looks at the day's menu board. Soup and pizza. Uhhuh. And then it's chili mac. Then I have a board meeting tonight. Only God knows what I'm going to serve them . The mission helps some of the poorest of Chicago's poor. Most of its clients are homeless men with drug or alcohol problems who never had a job. The director of the Greater Chicago Food Depository, Michael ^Mulqueen, says the booming _U_S economy has passed these people by. Despite low employment, unemployment, despite uh low interest rates, and despite all the positive indicators of the good times that this country is enjoying right now, that we have uh in Chicago a significant uh portion of the population that are largely unaffected by those good times. But the latest report on America's hungry says it is not just the country's homeless or drug addicted who are coming to food pantries and shelters for help. Martha ^Pickett of Chicago based Second Harvest, the nation's largest food bank network, says, increasingly, the people asking for help live away from the inner cities and often have a job. What we are seeing, though, is that the growth is in the suburban areas uh as opposed to y you often think of the hard core, you know, the urban poor. But where we're really seeing the growth is in the suburban areas. And these are primarily women and children and the working poor uh who are really trying to make ends meet. Second Harvest says the changing _U_S workplace is one reason for the growing need in the suburbs. A technology driven economy is leaving many people who do not have the necessary skills in low paying, often parttime jobs with little future. That puts extra pressure on food banks like the Greater Chicago Food Depository, which last year sent thirteen point one million kilograms of food to shelters, pantries, and soup kitchens in and around the city. A lot of that food ends up at the Pacific Garden Mission, where ^Floyd ^Turnbill says it feeds about fifteen hundred people each day. Fortunately, Pacific Garden Mission has a great network of food coming in. But I would say without the Food Depository's help, we would be hurting. Then we would have to spend more money to get what we want, to be able to feed the meals that we feed. Mr. ^Mulqueen of the Greater Chicago Food Depository is among those who worry the demand for food will become much greater when the _U_S economic boom comes to an end. We know if the economy goes south, uh then uh there are going to be a lot more people that uh are going to come to the agencies that are served by uh, that, that we serve, and uh, and the demand for our food and our services will uh go up. The Depository is also working with a local college on a new program to provide some welfare recipients in Chicago training in the food services industry. Mr. ^Mulqueen says he'd like to help people develop skills that'll put them in jobs that pay enough to make them Food Depository contributors rather than recipients.

 Amnesty International, the human rights group, is urging the _U_N human rights commission to take a tough stance against nations that violate the human rights of their citizens. Amnesty International is urging the commission to focus on six countries. Lisa ^Schlein has the story in Geneva. Amnesty International has singled out Algeria, Cambodia, Colombia, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, for special attention. It says these countries are guilty of a pattern of systematic, persistent, and severe human rights violations. The human rights group is especially critical of Algeria. It says it will demand international action to end six years of what it calls human rights atrocities in Algeria. Amnesty's director of legal affairs, ^Nicholas ^Howen, says about eighty thousand people have been killed since the start of the Algerian conflict. And in the essence of what is happening in Algeria is the impunity, that no one is brought to justice for what is happening, and so it continues. There is no other country in the world where the human rights violations are so extreme, but where there has been no international scrutiny, let alone action. No resolutions, no visits by experts. Nothing. Mr. ^Howen also says there must be an investigation into the killings of ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo. He says there's strong reason to believe that many of the people, including women and children, were victims of extrajudicial killings carried out by Serb soldiers. The office of the High Commission for Human Rights in Belgrade must urgently carry out an investigation in Kosovo province, be given full access, and be backed up by forensic experts. And most importantly, they must report to the Commission during the Commission. Because then it is the responsibility of the Commission to say what its nex next action should be. Mr. ^Howen sharply criticized the European Union's decision not to support any Commission resolution on China's human rights record. He says the _E_U action has already cast a shadow over the work of the Commission. He says the decision has more to do with policy splits between _E_U member states, and with lucrative markets, than with any real improvement in China's human rights situation.

 Nigeria's growing influence in the region is of concern here in the United States, as well, and has taken on added urgency as President Clinton prepares for his six nation tour of Africa later this month. Some leading _U_S scholars are urging Mr. Clinton to adopt a specific policy toward Nigeria. The scholars made their remarks at a forum here in Washington yesterday. We hear more from _V_O_A's ^Sonny Young. The keynote speaker at the forum was Susan Rice, the Assistant _U_S Secretary of State for African Affairs. She described Nigeria as one of the worst human rights abusers on the African continent. She said Africa's most populace country needs and deserves to be ruled by a truly civilian government. Secretary Rice said the United States will hold Nigeria's military ruler, General ^Sani ^Abacha, to his promise for free elections later this year. Our goal and expectation for Nigeria is the emergence of a stable, democratic government that respects human rights, that pursues responsible economic policies so that all Nigerians can benefit from the tremendous wealth of that country, and that plays a responsible role in regional affairs. General ^Abacha made very plain three years ago, whether or not you liked his transition program, that he would hand over to a civilian democratic government by October one, nineteen ninetyeight and it, made it very plain that he didn't intend to be a candidate. Now clearly, if he were to back away from that commitment to run as a candidate or if other military leaders were to do the same, that would be a source of grave concern to the United States and I believe to the people of Nigeria and many, many others. Ms. Rice said the Clinton Administration is in the process of finalizing internal discussions on Nigeria. She said as soon as the talks are complete, Administration officials will consult Congress and _U_S allies about what steps should be taken. Africa scholar ^Solly ^Booker responded to the Secretary's remarks. Mr. ^Booker is a senior fellow and director of the Africa Studies Program at the Council on Foreign Relations. He criticized the Clinton Administration for taking too long in formulating its policy toward Nigeria. We've not had a policy toward Nigeria for two years. So, it's simply awaiting a review of the Principles Committee. Uh, that is the Cabinet Secretaries, uh, with an interest in international affairs. And they're not likely to meet before the President goes on this trip. So the policy will remain under review. I think it will be significant if the President comments, either in response to journalists or as one of his prepared speeches, regarding the specifics of what the United States is prepared to do to support democratic forces, uh, in Nigeria and to even engage the ^Abacha regime in significant change because, while we welcome the comment Doctor Rice mentioned, uh, it doesn't suggest at all what _U_S policy toward that important country is going to be which effects the, uh, the prospects, uh, for the entire West African subregion and beyond. Nigeria's economic relationship with the United States and its impact on _U_S policy was pointed out by another scholar. John ^Stremlow is a professor at the University of ^Witwatersrand in South Africa. The economic numbers of _U_S relationship with Africa belie a much more sober reality. Eighty four percent of our trade is with only four countries and they're oil producers, by and large. South Africa is a manufacturing relationship and a more robust and a more normal relationship, but ^Gabone, ^Angola and Nigeria, we like to say that we have a nine billion dollar trade surplus with subSaharan Africa. Over five billion of that is the oil we're buying from Nigeria which is keeping the ^Abacha government in power. Africa scholar, John ^Stremlow, described Nigeria as an elephant in the living room of the United States. He said the country cannot be ignored. Mr. ^Stremlow urged the media to press President Clinton to give more details about _U_S policy toward Nigeria and its economic relationship with the United States. ^Sonny Young, _V_O_A News, Washington.

 The _U_S Supreme Court is hearing its first AIDS discrimination case. It involves a dentist from Maine who refused to treat an _H_I_V positive patient in his office, insisting that a hospital would work better protection from the virus. The patient sued, and so far two lower courts have ruled in her favor. The courts agreed the dentist violated the Americans With Disabilities Act which bars discrimination against the disabled in public places.

 Well, while millions of football fans all over the world are preoccupied with the World Cup football finals getting underway in France this June, one group in Paris has no interest in it at all. The group calls itself The Cup is Full and has been formed for French men and women who want nothing to do with any aspect of the tournament which runs from June tenth to July twelfth. The group has put together lists of bistros and cafes where owners have promised to turn their establishments into football free zones and refuse to broadcast any of the sixtyfour matches. It is also asking the theaters to remain open when France is playing. Cofounder ^Lauren ^Tereseray says that the group was formed because not everyone in France is a football fan, and that everyone cannot afford to flee the country during the World Cup.

 _U_S doctors have identified a mysterious AIDS fighting protein extracted from the urine of pregnant women. Doctor Robert Gallo first found that pregnant mice injected with an AIDS related cancer did not develop tumors. This led him to examine the hormone found in the urine of pregnant women. When tested on humans with the cancer, it shrank their tumors and also reduced the amount of AIDS virus in their blood. Doctor ^Gallo says a protein that clings to the hormone is responsible and that one day it could become a treatment for _H_I_V infection. This is _V_O_A Today.

 The _U_S government recently announced new regulations designed to change the way transplant organs are made available to sick patients. Under the new guidelines, donor organs will be made available to the sickest people first, wherever they live in the country. Currently, transplant organs are rationed through a regional system of distribution. The private group that runs the current system, United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS, objects to the new regulations. UNOS says the regulations put the federal government in charge of deciding who gets transplants and that many hospital transplant centers would be forced to close. Health and Human Services Secretary Do Donna ^Shalala says patients who need an organ transplant should not have to take a chance that an organ will become available in their local area, nor should patients have to travel to transplant centers far from their homes to improve their chances of getting an organ. UNOS spokeswoman Donna Henry ^Wright says the new policy would not necessarily be more fair or effective because allowances are already made for the most needy patients. The sickest patients are already treated first. There are not huge waiting uh disparit waiting time disparities amongst the very uh sickest patients. It's between two to six days for every one uh of the sickest patients across the country. um So it's a it's a fallacy that they're doing this because um the sickest patients aren't being served. Doctor James ^Burdick, the Professor of Transplant Surgery at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, and former President of UNOS, said the current system has evolved over several years and it works well. You may, in a year or two, save a few more lives if you do sickest first. But the number of patients waiting then begins to increase, um and, in fact, um over the years many more patients who are about to die of liver tra uh without a liver transplant would accumulate. If you do the uh alternative extreme, you don't save as many lives in the early years, by a small fraction. Our system is balanced, it's right in the middle. And, therefore, it works very well. Nationwide, there are about ten thousand patients waiting for liver transplants each year and only four thousand organs become available for transplants. Secretary ^Shalala says UNOS five months ago, or gave them five months to develop a new plan to distribute livers which are in the shortest supply. This is _V_O_A Today.

 Independent counsel Kenneth Starr says his probe of possible presidential wrongdoing in connection with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky will continue, despite Wednesday's dismissal of the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton. _V_O_A national correspondent Jim ^Malone has a report. Mr. Starr says there's no connection between his probe and the Jones lawsuit dismissed by a federal judge in Arkansas. Mr. Starr says his grand jury probe into allegations the President had an affair with Monica Lewinsky and then urged her to lie about it under oath will continue. Let's don't have spin. Let's don't have public relations. Let's deal with the facts. What are the facts? Let's let those facts come out. Wrapping up his Africa trip in Senegal, President Clinton said he was pleased with the decision in the Jones case and eager to refocus on domestic priorities. And I'm very much looking forward to going home and continuing the work of the very ambitious agenda we've got there. The democratic minority leader in the Senate, Tom ^Daschle, says dismissal of the Jones lawsuit takes steam out of any potential effort by Republicans to push for the President's impeachment.

 The owners of ^Wembley Stadium in England have agreed in principle to sell the venue known as the home of English football for one hundred seventy million dollars in cash. ^Wembley Stadium Limited announced the on Thursday it had agreed to that sale, which would clear for the way for ^Wembley to be rebuilt into a stateoftheart national stadium for the twentyfirst century. The sale, which would transfer ownership of the English, or to the English national stadium trust, is contingent on the agreement of ^Wembley shareholders. The deal is expected to be finalized in mid June, but ^Wembley will continue to own and operate the stadium until the sale is completed on June thirtieth, nineteen ninetynine. The stadium trust plans to spend an additional two hundred thirty million dollars to renovate the structure, which will be completely torn down except for the famous Twin Towers. The building work is scheduled to start after next year's _F_A Cup final, with the stadium reopening in the year two thousand two.

 After thirty years of conflict, and two years of talks, an agreement has been reached to bring peace to Northern Ireland. Former _U_S senator George ^Mitchell made the announcement in Belfast after an intense negotiating session involving eight political parties and the prime ministers of Britain and Ireland. To those who disdain democracy, to those whose tools are bombs and bullets, your way is not the right way. You will never solve the problems of Northern Ireland by violence. You will only make them worse. It doesn't take courage to shoot a policeman in the back of the head or to murder an unarmed taxi driver. What takes courage is to compete in the arena of democracy as these men and women are here tonight where the tools are persuasion, fairness, and common sense. George ^Mitchell. The historic agreement creates an elective assembly in Northern Ireland and a north south council linking municipal functions between Ireland and northern Ireland. The British and Irish governments want to present the document in a referendum this May. The announcement ends nearly two years of intensive talks. President Clinton hailed the peace agreement for Northern Ireland, saying the strife torn British province now has the promise of a springtime of peace. The president called on all parties concerned to stand together to defy any attempt to undermine the agreement either through words or violence. The agreement that has emerged from the Northern Ireland peace talks opens the way for the people there to build a society based on enduring peace, justice, and equality. The vision and commitment of the participants in the talks has made real the prayers for peace on both sides of the Atlantic and both sides of the peace line. All friends of Ireland and Northern Ireland know the task of making the peace endure will be difficult. The path of peace is never easy. But the parties have made brave decisions. They have chosen hope over hate. Mr. Clinton said the agreement opens the way for people in Northern Ireland to build a society based on enduring peace, justice, and equality. President Clinton said he talked to the parties at the Belfast peace talks several times Thursday night and early Friday urging them to seize the opportunity to reach an agreement.

 inter Milan defeated ^Spartak Moscow of Russia two to one and ^Lazio of Rome has played ^Athletico ^Madrid of Spain to a scoreless draw to qualify for an all Italian ^Nueva cup final next month. ^Lazio relied on defense, defense to reach their first ever European football final in a tense and scrappy match that was played at Rome's Olympic stadium. The draw gave the Romans a one nothing aggregate victory after its first leg one nothing road win. Meanwhile, Brazilian football star ^Renaldo scored both goals in inter Milan's two to one victory over ^Spartak Moscow to lead the team to the finals for the second year in a row. The second leg win allowed ^Inter to advance on a four to two aggregate score after winning the fist leg match in Milan two weeks ago by an identical two to one score.

 United Airlines, the largest _U_S air carrier, has ordered twentythree jumbo jets from Boeing Company worth up to three point two billion dollars. The order is made up mostly of Boeing seven seventysevens. Analysts say the order shows the airline's optimism about its international expansion plans, even as traffic slows in the Asia Pacific Region. United said, uh, last month that its expansion plans include adding sixtyeight planes to its five hundred seventyone plane fleet by the end of two thousand one.

 Inspectors and workmen are checking Yankee Stadium to make sure that there are no more structural problems after a steel beam in the upper deck collapsed Monday afternoon. The first two of three games between the Yankees and ^Anaheim Angels had to be postponed after the two hundred twentyseven kilogram steel beam crashed into the seats. ^Sonny ^Hyeth, the Director of Stadium Operations, says the beam was part of the original structure built seventyfive years ago. We believe that this was an isolated uh incident. It was a piece of the stadium that was built in nineteen twentythree. w So far we've not been able to uncover any other parts of the stadium that have a similar type of expansion joint, but we are going to check every one of the joints in the stadium. Nearby ^Shea Stadium will now be quite busy on Wednesday. The Yankees will play an afternoon game against ^Anaheim in the home of the New York Mets. And the Mets will play a night game against the Chicago Cubs. The mishap is likely to fuel speculation that the Yankees should move from the Bronx to a new stadium. New York Mayor Rudolph ^Giuliani says both teams are entitled to new facilities. Both the Yankees and the Mets are entitled to new baseball fields. I've said that over and over again. The uh the best reason for it is that the cities that have new baseball fields are substantially out drawing the Yankees and the Mets. And these are th two of the best teams in baseball in the largest city in America. Yankees' owner George ^Steinbrenner has often said he wants to move the team from the old stadium, known affectionately as the House That Ruth Built.

 In his latest book called Tales of Love and Longing in Bombay, the Indian writer ^Vicram ^Chandra conjures up a chaotic, vivid, endlessly varied city. The thirtyseven year old author, who is from Bombay, was recently named a finalist for this year's Commonwealth Writer's Prize to be announced in Jamaica on Thursday. In today's round table, ^Vicram ^Chandra tells ^Carolyn ^Weaver how he began the five connected stories that make up Tales of Loving and Longing. The way it started was that I've, I have a brotherinlaw, my sister and my brotherinlaw live in a Bombay suburb called ^Bondra and I would go down to visit them in these things called auto racers, which are sort of like scooters with a chassis built on the back of them, uh, sort of like little taxis. And we would drive down the waterfront and there were these amazing bungalows, colonial bungalows which were empty. And I would ask them, how, how is it that in a c city which has the most expensive real estate in the world, uh can these houses be empty. And they would always say ^Sab, it's a, it's, it's a budpangla, which means it's a haunted house. And then they would spin off this elaborate tale of why it was haunted and somebody had died in it when they tried to sleep over night in it. So I thought, I I I love ghost stories so I thought I should try and do one. Um, so when I finished that I started to think about what other kinds of stories I, that I like. So the next one was ^Shate, which became, uh, uh which was an eg an example from your friend who worked within th the story of social combat in drawing rooms, and great ladies at war. Um, and I really had a great time writing it. Uh, the third is a detective story, uh which s starts as all good detective stories must, with a dead body in water. Um, and then there's a story about um greed, I suppose you could say, um and the nature of work. And then finally a love story of sorts. How confident did you feel writing about lives that weren't like yours? Well, you just sort of have to take the plunge. Um, otherwise we'd be stuck writing about ourselves, really. That question in a more pointed way comes up every so often, I think, nowadays, with this idea of appropriation of voices and, and the ability of writers to take over the voices of others. And I think it's a s it's actually, i it's a misplaced concern, because that's what artists do. We lie about being other people. And if you're doing it well, then the simulation is seamless. And the detail and the texture convinces the reader that you know what you're talking about. I, I, I live in Bombay for about half the year and move through these various worlds and I'm content to take notes as I go along. For a couple of the stories there was more specific research. For the cop, uh there's a story in there uh called Kama, which has a police inspector as a protagonist. And for that I would just go and meet policemen and hang out in police stations and um my main purpose in doing that is to pick up detail. Um, I I'm not convinced that one couldn't have written the same story without being there, but, but it makes it easier for me. I wanted to ask you to read just uh a short passage from the beginning of that story. Sure. The body was almost submerged in the ditch, but what ^Sirtaj noticed about it, as he squatted beside it, was its expression of pride. One arm was curved out of the water and rigid. The passerby who had found the body was a driver on his way to the milk stand for his bottles, and he had seen, through the rain, a hand reaching up out of the rushing stream as if for something. It had been raining for three days and three nights and through the morning now, and the water was actually roaring as it pushed below a culvert. The dead man was jammed in between the curving brick wall and the broken m metal grill. The driver had stood next to the ditch and shouted and the people in the nearby buildings had come out and then he had stood guard until the police came. He seemed to think that somehow it was his responsibility since he had found it, but now he was trying not to look down at it. The skin of the palm of the hand that emerged from the water was a strange bluish gray. Who do you see, uh when you're, when you're writing? Who are you writing for? Is it an Indian audience of readers or is it readers in English all over the world? It's actually a very specific and very small audience. Um, it's my sisters and a friend of mine, uh a couple of friends of mine, uh one of whom happens to be American and my mother. And I show them what I'm doing pretty soon after I write it, I mean maybe a couple of pages sent by email uh the day after I've written it. And so I keep getting constant feedback from them. It's hard for me to imagine any audience larger than that. Because even if I was to say that I'm writing for an Indian audience, that phrase Indian audience sort of falls apart the minus minute you start to press at it a little. What does it mean? Um, i if, if you live in Bombay, which itself is a multilingual, multiethnic culture, um you have some sense of the audience out there, but it's hard to write for such a various collection of people. So I write immediately for these people and I'm glad that other people read it, but I'm not certain that I know how they're going to respond or have any sense of them. Um, in my first novel, Red Earth and Pouring Rain, th the narrator is actually a monkey who sits at a typewriter and types out the stories. And he's sitting in a study and there's a little family inside with him and he types the stories to them. They pick it up and they read it on loud speakers which transmits it to a larger audience outside, on the ground outside. Um and he thinks of that larger audience as a fearful adversary which can never be completely known. One reviewer said that you weren't afraid to be old fashioned. Do you agree with that? Sure. I mean, I'm not quite sure what that means. uh I, I suspect what he means is that I like to tell stories in which things happen, in which people do good and bad things to each other. In which the characters are greedy and vicious and want things, that they're sort of densely plotted. A kind, the kind of story that, for instance, ^Shate is, in which two great ladies plot each other's downfall over a period of, what, twenty years. It's fairly unusual and would be considered old fashioned. But it's just the kind of story that I like to read and therefore I like to write. It's what interests me.
